The group crosses the silent hallway leading to the Administrator's office.
They carry the paper carefully. The monks at the door let them in.
Administrator Kim stands behind his desk.
Next to the wall, chained to a chair, sits Li-Tse.
Her face is pale but her eyes burn with defiance.

ADMINISTRATOR: So. You found it.
Give it to me.

LI-TSE: Do not give it to him! This would be the end.

**The group freezes. What to do?**

ADMINISTRATOR: You understand what this is you stole, I hope.
Any guess?

You can say it if you have a guess.

ADMINISTRATOR: The recipe for eternal life. The true secret of Shangri-La.
Four centuries ago, a priest from Luxembourg, Father Perrault, crossed the world.
He found this valley and discovered what others only dreamed of.
He built Shangri-La as a refuge, a memory of humankind.
And he is still alive.
The Grand Lama is that same man, four hundred years old.
Wilfred sees all this as a blessing.
Others want to share it like a superpower.
I know it is a chance, but it is also a burden. A curse.
This gift should be given only to those who have proven they can bear it.
Too many in Shangri-La already live longer than they deserve.
They squandered it away; it lost all meaning.
Your presence alone, foreigners, is an affront.
This place must remain protected, closed to the world.
I despise the idea that we should be a museum for humanity,
a last chance for the world.
No. We exist as a people. We are our own chance.

LI-TSE: Ridiculous. This is your utopia?
Self-appointed serious men living forever in fear?
You act so serious because what you do is so meaningless.
If you ever realized it, you would not stop laughing.
Foreigners, why did you denounce me?
Do you not see what I believe in?
I want everyone in the world to have access to eternal life,
to know what is possible.
Do you not see it would end wars,
give meaning to everyone?
Help me! Free me! Let us escape together with the formula and change the world!

ADMINISTRATOR: Change the world?
I have eternal life and I am fearful and miserable.
The world will still be driven by greed and power.
We all know that.
These foreigners denounced you for safety and worked for me for money.
They are reliable humans, mortal or immortal; it makes no difference.
People, give me that recipe and you can become immortal yourselves,
rule your cities like gods, and leave Shangri-La alone.
Come on.

Who will the group decide to trust with the formula?
