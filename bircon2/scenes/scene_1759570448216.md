The group finds itself in a long service hallway.

In front of the group, two opened door. 

The left one seems to be a large traversing walk-in pantry. Dark and quiet. 

The right door leads to a big kitchen, quite busy, where several cooks are working, shaking their woks above fire.

Will the group choose the quiet path or the busy one through the kitchen?
