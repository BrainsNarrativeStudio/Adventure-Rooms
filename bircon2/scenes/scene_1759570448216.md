The group finds itself in a long service hallway.

One can hear the sound of dinner happening in a far way room. Better to stay away from this.

In front of the group, two opened door leads to a big busy kitchen.

The left door leads to a series of stoves where several cooks are working, shaking their woks above fire. Super busy.

The right door leads to a quieter working space, where one lonely chef is super focused on the decoration of a cake.

Will the group choose the busy path or the quiet one through the kitchen?
