This is a kid's room!

He's still sleeping.

The group tries to be as discreet as possible as they're' crossing the room towards the main door.

But sadly, the old creaking door has an old lock that is a bit tricky.

Will you manage to open the door without waking up the child?

This is your first challenge. You must choose of of you to be the challenger. You have to succcesfully follow the line without a noise. You have three tries. If you fail, you will wake up the kid.
