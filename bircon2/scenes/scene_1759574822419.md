Turning right in the hallway, the group rounds the corner, when, suddenly:

Three big black guard dogs are looking at them, growling. They're caught. or?

{{#has "Grabbed the platter"}}
The dogs seem fascinated by the smell of the cheeses on the platter you're carrying.

Quick, what do your characters do?

Back away or feed them the cheese?
{{/has}}

{{#hasNot "Grabbed the platter"}} Quick, what do you do?

Back away or pet them to try to pass behind them? {{/hasNot}}
