**You have 5 minutes to get your answer**

The group can be divided between the people talking to the Administrator, and the ones checking the document for possible topics and angles.

THE GAME:

Kim starts calm, rational, courteous.
He sees himself as the only realist in a city of dreamers.
If three of the five triggers below are mentioned, Kim loses control and reveals his true intentions: he is leading a faction to overthrow the Lama and take control of Shangri-La.

TRIGGERS

1. The Lost Love (emotional)
If the players mention or hint that years ago Kim had a close relationship with one of the outsiders invited by the Grand Lama, it strikes a nerve.
That person left the valley, refusing to stay.
The rejection shattered Kim's trust in all newcomers and made him despise the Lama's policy of openness.
He calls it the beginning of corruption.

2. The Broken Faith (spiritual)
If they mention that Kim removed the engravings or statues of the Sacred Mountain from his office, he tries to dismiss it as renovation.
The truth: he no longer feels the Mountain's presence.
He has lost all spiritual connection to Shangri-La.
He believes in people and order, not invisible harmony or symbols.

3. The Failing Body (physical)
If someone mentions his weakening sight, his fatigue, or his new habit of dictating reports, he reacts sharply.
He fears losing capacity, being diminished, becoming weak while still alive.
He feels time pressing on him, and he wants to secure power before it is taken away.
If pushed, he bursts: "I will not fade while the Lama drifts into dreams."

4. The Hidden Recruits (political)
If they bring up his new guards, transfers, or "special details," he first claims they are security measures.
But it is true: he has built a loyal network to seize control when the time comes.
If two other triggers are already touched, this one will make him explode.

5. The Scorn for Art (cultural)
If they mention that he no longer attends the readings, concerts, or poetry gatherings, he reacts with contempt.
He sees culture as distraction, proof of decay.
He thinks Shangri-La wastes its energy on art while the world outside sharpens its weapons.
He may say: "The Lama builds choirs while the mountains tremble. I build walls."

WHEN THREE TRIGGERS ARE REACHED: SUCCESS

Kim snaps.
His calm shatters into rage and certainty.
He throws off all pretense and declares his purpose.

Enough! Yes, I am gathering men. Yes, I will act.
The Grand Lama has lost the world.
Wilfred drowns us in music while the walls crack.
Shangri-La is rotting under their faith in poetry and peace.
I will not watch it die.
I will take command, restore order, and build a city that survives.
Call it treason if you want. I call it duty.

After this, Kim steadies himself, breathing hard.
He does not regret it.
He feels liberated.
He believes that he has spoken truth at last.

IF THE TRIGGERS ARE NOT REACHED: FAILURE
At the end of the timer, Admin Kim sits down, bored by the group.
