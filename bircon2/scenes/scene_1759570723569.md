  The group is being brought back to the Library. The silence is heavy between them. They hope they did the right choice. Brother Wilfriend enters the room, relieved to everyone back here.

Brother Wildried turns to you.

"Thank you for your honesty and for denouncing this chaos maker. Shangri-La has seen more demonstration of unsatisfaction lately. I welcome all critics, but these methods are no good. See, these people don't know the exterior world like you do. They do not know how terrible it can be - corruption, violence, war, dictature... and therefore they feel the small faults in our utopia are gigantic problems... But they do not need to act so secretely, creating division. They still respect the Grand Lama, wisely, and the Lama hopes you people can actually help us with all this."
