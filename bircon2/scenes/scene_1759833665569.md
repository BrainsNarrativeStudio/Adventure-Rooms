One of the characters grabs the chair.
Without hesitation, they throw it into the mirror.

The glass breaks in a long, sliding sound, a slow fall of silver dust.

Behind it, hidden in the wall, a metal safe appears.
Old. Heavy. Its surface engraved with the same line of mountains descending from high to low.

In place of a lock, a row of alphabetical wheels.
The code needs X letters (number of players)

For a moment, the charcaters all stand still.
The sound of the breaking glass still echoing somewhere deep in the palace.
No turning back now.
Whatever secret this room holds, they have to find it fast. 

**You have two minutes to figure out and tell me the code.**

(after one minute, if needed, the narrator may add: "The carved mountains seem to descend in order...  Perhaps the code follows the same path")
