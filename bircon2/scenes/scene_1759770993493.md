The group inspects the library for a moment, leafing through many old books in dozens of languages, opening dusty almanachs, unrolling many maps. 

Until they settle on a few of these that seems pertinent to what they're trying to do. Somehow, within these documents, they should find which ones is the door to the secret door; and the way to get in.

**You have ten minutes to go through these objects and choose one of the door and see if you figured out how to get in. You are allowed two mistakes (either wrong door or wrong method to open it)**


IF they go to a wrong door: nothing happens. 

IF they go to the right door. A timid and scared voice of a woman inside asks: "What do you know?"

If they say anything other than the password: the woman screams: "Move away! I am armed and have orders to shoot any trespassers!"

If they tell the password, then success.
