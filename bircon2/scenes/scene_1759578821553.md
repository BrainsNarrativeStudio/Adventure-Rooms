The pastry chef is very busy decorating a cake.

But he's very happy to talk to you. Too happy.

He tells you about how he's proud to have learned so much about French pastries here thanks to the Grand Lama. Hard to adapt with Yack butter.

Shangri-la has hundreds of cook books from all over the world.

If you try to interrupt him: you cut him... he cuts you! Get one wound.

You need to listen to him: he's regretting that everyone here is vegetarian, cause he'd love to try some andouilette. Or Pot au Feu.

Do you want to listen to him more?
