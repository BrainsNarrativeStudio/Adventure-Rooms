After a moment, Wilfried enters the room and seems relieved to see the entire group here. 

"I hope your little... escapade was fun. You could have asked if you wanted to explore already this night... Have you... met anyone? No? I confess that we've been having some challenges lately. Shangri-La has seen more demonstration of unsatisfaction. I welcome all critics, but their methods are no good. See, these people don't know the exterior world like you do. They do not know how terrible it can be - corruption, violence, war, dictature... and therefore they feel the small faults in our utopia are gigantic problems... But they do not need to act so secretely, creating division. They still respect the Grand Lama, wisely, and the Lama hopes you people can actually help us with all this.

I tell you all this just in case someone tries to get in touch with you with strange demands.
