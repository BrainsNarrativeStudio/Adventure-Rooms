Wilfried tells you all about the real mission of Shangri-La the Grand Lama wants you to help with. 

Ark of culture for the wolrd, beacon, hope, ... 

Music pieces from Chopin and arts from whoever. 

How can this be? 

One last room you need to go. 

The secret room that I'm sure many enemies of the lama would dream to get access to. I trust you so much that I will guide you myself there.
