gestures at the music room around him. 

""Do you know what this place really is?
It is not a monastery, not only a city.
It is a vault.
A refuge for the memory of humankind.
Every poem, every melody, every gesture worth remembering, we keep it here.
When the world forgets, we remember.

The artists vanished long ago, yet their work continued here.

Look, that music sheet for a Chopin's piece the world outside Shangri-La never heard.

The Grand Lama now believes you are ready.
There is one last room you must enter.
A secret that many of our enemies would give their lives to reach.
But I trust you.
I will guide you there myself."
