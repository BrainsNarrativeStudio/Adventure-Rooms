The group sucessfully climbs down the window, helping one another, and land on a spacious balcony one level down. The balcony runs along two different rooms, and you can look through the bay windows:

On the left, a dark and quiet room, probably a bedroom. You can guess that someone is sleeping in there.

On the right, the curtains are drawn, and the characters cannot see anything inside except the dancing light of a fireplace through the fabric.

Do you think the group chooses the known risk or the total unknown?
