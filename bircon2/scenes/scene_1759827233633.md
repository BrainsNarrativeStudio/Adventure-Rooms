As soon as the group mentions this sentence, the woman inside shuts up, and the characters hear the different locks of the door being opened one by one.

The woman looks at the group with reverence, "I didn't know Wilfried had already trusted you with that knowledge. Heavy is the crown. We believe in you. Praise the Mountain!" 

She agitates with an old WW1 rifle, and puts it down, ashamed. "This is one of the only firearms in Shangri-La. We're not used to violence here, but I don't have to tell you how important what's in this room is. I mean, you know better than anyone".

With that, she leaves the group alone in the tiny room.
