  The group is frustrated but also more puzzled about this place. Are they treated like guests or like prisoners? They barely have time to argue about what to do next when a figure enters the room through the same window they used to escape earlier.It's a woman,dressed in black and her face half covered. She seems stressed and whispers.It's a woman, dressed in black and her face half covered. She seems stressed and whispers.
  
  REBEL LEADER: ""Oh, thank the Mountain! You're back here! I was not you. Please, listen to me.""

 As the group slowly walks down the staircase, they hear "psss psss".Someone is calling them from inside a closet. It's a woman, dressed in black and her face half covered. She seems stressed and whispers.

REBEL LEADER: ""Oh, thank the Mountain! I found you in time. Are you trying to escape? I understand, I would react the same way. But... Please, listen to me. Do not leave yet."

" A lot of people in our valley need you help. I don't know what you already know about Shangri-La... But it's a lie, not everything is perfect here. Of course, we respect the Grand Lama, without him the place would go up in flames. But he's being lied to, or his obessions are out of the realities of today. I fight for a valley that will have even more freedom, where evryone can access the same chances, where we could actually help the world. Your world. And... I don't have time to explain everything, the monks are everywhere here. What I know: Brother Wilfried keeps an important secret in his office. Because he needs you for his plans at the ceremony tomorrow, you are welcomed here. It is our only chance to change the power forces in the valley. We, the people, need to know what's hidden in his office.

  ""Please, do not escape, go back to the library try to get hold of whatever Wilfried is hiding. You don't have a lot of time until he moves you out of the palace.

. Once you're there, I'll contact you again. Please. Do not let us down.

As she leaves, she's being noticed by an angry guard who threatens her and almost catches her as she uses a rope to climb out of the palace external walls.

The words of the woman echoes in your mind. Should you listen to her and go back to the library? Or do you ignore her plea and continue your escape?
