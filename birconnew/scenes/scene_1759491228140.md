Berlin, Tempelhof Airport. Winter 1933.

Hundreds of travelers hurry through the hall, wrapped in thick coats, faces tense.
Whispers spread like smoke from every mouth: fear.
Fear of war, of hate, of the new chancellor.
Germany has changed. Everyone feels it.

Who could be our protagonist here?
Who can carry this story forward?

A man in his forties, small mustache, bright eyes, walks fast toward the boarding desk.
Robert Conway.
Forty years old. A British officer turned diplomat, once a hero of the Great War, now haunted by it.

Ask the players:
1. What is Conway wearing?
2. In his pocket, he carries a souvenir given by his mother. What is it?
3. What memory from the war still haunts him?
4. He got a scar in the trenches where is this scar, and how does it feel?
5. What advice from his late father does he think about often?
6. What is his favorite food?

(Distribute a Story Point token to each player who answers.)

Conway boards the plane to Shanghai.
Small craft, fewer than twenty passengers, wicker seats, engines trembling already.

He looks around.

A young Indian man, tall and serious, is trying not to show how nervous he feels about flying.
He smooths his jacket, adjusts a pillow, stares straight ahead the kind who hides fear behind discipline.

Across the aisle, a woman in a bright red coat. Conway thinks he recognizes her.
A famous cabaret star from Berlin's posters.
She complains softly to a steward about the cold air, then laughs and lights a cigarette.
The man beside her, older, balding, dressed in an expensive suit and fur coat, annoys the singer with stories about Buenos Aires and champagne.
He winks at the passengers nearby, generous and loud with his South American accent.

Conway sits down beside the Indian man.
A quiet neighbor about to fall asleep. Perfect.
Conway is a man looking for peace.

Peace is what got him on that plane.
He opens his coat pocket and reads that strange letter again.
A curious job offer in China.
A promise of peace, cooperation, and a better world.
A project no one has heard of.
The ticket was paid for. The invitation was signed only with initials.
He knows it could be a trap.
But even a trap is better than going through the motions in his London office.

Engines roar.
The plane rises.
Berlin fades into white.
Conway imitates his neighbor and falls asleep.

Apprentices, look at your Appraisal Sheet. You have a check mark next to "Leave Berlin". Cross it for a Story Point! This is how we use these forms.



Hours later.

The hostess walks down the aisle, pale.
Something is wrong.
They should have landed long ago.

She bangs on the cockpit door. No answer.
Again. Harder. Still nothing.

A French person, in their fifties, dressed simply but with composure, stands and takes the hostess by the shoulders, helps her breathe, and leads her back to her seat.

Conway cannot ignore a chance to help others.
He stands too, offers water.

The hostess whispers to him, shaking.
It is not our pilot. I do not know the man flying this plane!

Behind Conway, a Japanese woman in her early thirties, wearing glasses, reading a thick scientific book, lifts her head, alert.
She grips her briefcase.
What did she say? Are we being hijacked?

The word fills the cabin.
Everyone freezes.

Everything starts shaking.

The Indian man wakes up suddenly, alert and scanning for danger.
The cabaret star starts singing to give herself courage.
The French person runs to the cockpit door to plead with whoever is flying the plane.
The businessman stares at the window, face blank, and starts praying.

Conway also looks outside and sees something that should not be there.
Mountains.
Snow peaks.
We are flying above the Himalayas!
And far too low.

Conway shouts, voice sharp.
He is trying to land! Brace!

The plane tilts. The engines scream.
Then silence.

The plane has crashed.
