But before the group can move and give the paper,
another voice cuts through the tension.

ADMINISTRATOR: Arrest them.
The Grand Lama has been found dead in his chambers. Murdered.
And these outsiders were seen sneaking through the palace.
It has to be them.

WILFRIED: What are you saying? The Grand Lama. Dead? That is impossible.

ADMINISTRATOR: Take them. All of them.

Monks run to circle the courtyard.
Nowhere to go.

Will the group manage to prove their innocence by finding the killer? Will they help the rebellion?

You will be able to do it yourself next year in the full BRAINSCAPE!

Thank you for being our first test players!

Now let's see what overall scores you got.
