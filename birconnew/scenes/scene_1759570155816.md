The Administrator hesitates, then leans forward and lowers his voice.

"I understand. You want to go back to your lives. You have no interest in staying here. Shangri-La has nothing to offer you and you have nothing to bring to Shangri-La.

I will let you go. But if you're caught again by Brother Wilfried's monks, you're on your own. This stays between us.

And if you make it out of the palace, look for Old Man Jenkins in the marketplace. He's been planning to leave the valley for years. He's the one you'll need if you ever want to see your families again.

But I didn't say anything..."

He straightens, already returning to his papers as if they were never there.

Carlotta studies him for a second that calm, cold mask and wonders what game this man is really playing.

The Administrator goes back to his work. The trio can now leave his room and return to the hallway without trouble.
