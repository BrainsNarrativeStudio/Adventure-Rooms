The Admnitrator hesitates, then, in a whisper:

"I understand, you want to go back to your lives. You have no interest in staying here. Shangri-La has nothing to offer you. And you have nothing to bring to Shangri-La.

I will let you go. But if you get caught again by Brother Wilfdried's monks, you're on your own. It's our little secret.

And after escaping the palace, try to find Old Man Jenkins in the marketplace. He's been planning to climb out of the valley for years. He's the one you need if you want to one day see your families again.

But I didn't say anything...

**The Administrator goes back to his work. You can now leave his room and get back to the hallway without problem**
