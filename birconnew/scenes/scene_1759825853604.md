WILFRIED leads the group down a narrow hallway lined with doors, each marked with a different symbol.
He stops before one of them and whispers to the lock,
"Among the strangers walks the next Lama."

The lock clicks open.

Inside, a frightened young woman holding a rifle stares at them. Her eyes dart from face to face the stewardess, the businessman, the French activist, the Japanese scientist, the Indian detective, and Carlotta, still pale from doubt. Then her expression softens into awe, as if she's standing before saints or kings.
She bows and quickly leaves.

Wilfried gestures toward the open doorway.
"This is the last step. You know what to do. The answer is within you."

The group enters.

The room is small and bare, lit by a few trembling candles. A single chair. And on the far wall, a massive mirror reflecting their faces back at them.

For a moment, no one speaks.
They study themselves what they have become since entering the palace.
It was only a few hours ago, yet everything feels different.
What kind of world have they stepped into?
What truth are they about to uncover?

Along both side walls runs a carved relief: a chain of mountains, descending toward the mirror, as if the peaks themselves were pointing to it.

They approach.
The mirror is cold, heavy, and impossible to move.
No hinges. No handle.
Only their own faces, staring back.

SHLACK. The door closes down behind them. 

What is there to do??

**Candidates, we need your help. The story is blurry... What can Benicio do in this situation?**

*(DO NOT GIVE THEM THE OPTIONS -LET THEM RPG, SEE WHAT THEY DECIDE)*

*Nothing to do in the room, no secret lever or button, the only thing to do is grab the chair and break the mirror*
