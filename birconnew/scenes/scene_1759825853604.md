  Wilfried leads the group to a hallway with many doors, all bearing a symbol. He stops in front of one of them and says, whispering, to the lock: "Among the strangers walk the next Lama". Lockes open. A scared little woman holding a rifle looks at the group first suspisioucly, then her smile grows, like she's being in the presence of a king or even a God. She bows then leaves. Wilfried invites the group to enter the small room and tell them: "This is the last step, you know what to do, the answer is within you"

The group enters the small secret room. Surprisingly bare. A few candles. A chair. And a giant mirror covering most of the far wall.

For a moment, they look at their faces.
Reflections of what they have become since entering the palace.
It was only a few hours ago, yet everything feels changed.
In what world have they found themselves?
What secret are they about to unveil?

On both side walls runs the same carved relief:
a line of mountains, from high to low,
descending toward the mirror,
as if the peaks themselves were pointing to it.

They approach.
The mirror is cold, heavy, and impossible to open.
No hinges. No handle. Only their faces, looking back.

**Are they sure this is the room they were looking for?
If so, do they take the risk of breaking the mirror?**
