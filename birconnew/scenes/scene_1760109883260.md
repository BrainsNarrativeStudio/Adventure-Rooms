Benicio Torres straightens his jacket and surveys the room.
The others are shaken, whispering about guilt, justice, morality the usual distractions of people who still believe in right and wrong.
Benicio doesn't have that problem.

He's surprised the cabaret dancer looks so broken, suddenly.
Stars all burn out, he thinks.

They tell him what happened how Carlotta betrayed the rebel woman, how this Li-Tsen spoke of hidden documents and secret rooms.
Benicio listens, smiling faintly.
A secret document? A shift in power? Rebels and monks fighting for control?
He can almost smell the opportunity.

He sees what others don't: an opening.
A power vacuum.
And a palace full of people desperate for someone who looks like he knows what he's doing.

Just days ago, he was escaping police across the world after half of Buenos Aires discovered his grand real-estate empire was nothing more than an elaborate pyramid scheme.
His name in every newspaper.
His accounts frozen.
His "friends" suddenly very busy.

But luck, like Benicio, has a talent for survival.
And now, after a crash in the middle of nowhere, he's found the one thing a man like him needs most: a place where no one knows his name.

He just has to stay calm, smile at the right people, flatter the ones in charge, and never, ever mention the past.

Maybe he won't need to return to the outside world after all.
Maybe Shangri-La is exactly what he's been searching for a place to start over, rewrite his story, and this time, get it right.

And maybe succeeding here would be the best tribute to that poor chap who died to save him earlier.
Conway, wasn't it? A noble fool but still, Benicio owes him that much.


**Candidates! Before the game continues, tell us a bit more about Benicio Torres:**
What is the most expensive gift he ever bought for himself?
He has a health problem. What is it?
Who was his best friend?
What is his go-to drink?
Who is he still in love with?
Where was he really going after Shanghai?



Benicio readies himself as he hears the door open.
