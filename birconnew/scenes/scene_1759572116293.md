Carlotta can't help a grin as the group slips past the last guard.
They did it!

But then a whisper cuts through the cold air.
Behind the pillar of the exit door, a figure: a woman, dressed in black.

Carlotta's first instinct: ignore her. Keep walking.
Whoever this woman is, if she talks to them, she will attract attention.

REBEL LEADER:
"Oh, thank the Mountain! I found you in time before you disappear. I can't believe you managed to escape! I understand, I would react the same way if I were in your shoes. But... please, listen to me. Do not leave yet.

A lot of people in our valley need your help. I don't know what you already know about Shangri-La... but it's a lie, not everything is perfect here. Of course, we respect the Grand Lama without him, the place would go up in flames. But he's being lied to, or his obsessions are out of touch with the realities of today. I fight for a valley that will have even more freedom, where everyone can access the same chances, where we could actually help the world your world. And... I don't have time to explain everything, the monks are everywhere here.

What I know: Brother Wilfried keeps an important document in a secret room near the library. Because he needs you for his plans at the ceremony tomorrow, you are welcome there. It is our only chance to change the power forces in the valley. We, the people, need to get a hold of what's hidden in this room.

Please, do not escape. Surrender to a monk, go back to your quarters. Please, go. You don't have a lot of time until he moves you out of the palace. You need to identify which of the many doors on that floor is the one to that secret room and how to open it. I've received intel that you'll find all you need in the library! And my informer managed to get this overview of all the doors on that floor. Take it. Please, your success holds the key to our rebellion.

My name is Li-Tsen, and my people rely entirely on you. If you do this for us, I promise we will help you go back to your lives in the outside world. And you'll be forever known as heroes around here. Forever. Oh no!"

Carlotta knew it: that big speech caught a monk's attention. And the alarm has been raised. Damn it! She was a few meters from being free.

Li-Tsen bolts away, swift as a shadow. The angry monk gives chase, but she's faster. Gone.
Carlotta exhales, relieved for this woman she just met.

Then she realizes that this rebel just took her one chance to escape.

Three months, carrying torches, are circling them. No way to run.
Carlotta is now shoved and forced to walk back to the palace.

And yet... she can't shake a sting of admiration she felt for that rebel woman.
That fire. That impossible courage to stand for something.

What to do now? 
They could accept the mission the woman gave them, but why would they risk everything for this stranger? That's abit too easy to ask them to do all the dangerous stuff! But her promise of freedom is tempting...

Wait. Carlotta now thinks she could denounce Li-Tsen, punish her for robbing them of this escape. It will certainly earn the monks' trust, too, now that they're being brought back... A good insurance policy to soften the blow of their escape...

Should Carlotta believe the rebel's promise and accept this secret mission? Or should she put her interests first and turn Li-Tsen in?
