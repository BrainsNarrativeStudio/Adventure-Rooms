Carlotta can't help a grin as the group slips past the last guard.
They did it.

But then a whisper cuts through the cold air.
From the corner of the courtyard, a small garden shed.
A figure inside: a woman, dressed in black.

Carlotta's first instinct: ignore her.
But there's something magnetic in that whisper: sharp, urgent.

REBEL LEADER:
"Oh, thank the Mountain! I found you in time before you disappear. I can't believe you managed to escape! I understand, I would react the same way if I were in your shoes. But... please, listen to me. Do not leave yet.

A lot of people in our valley need your help. I don't know what you already know about Shangri-La... but it's a lie, not everything is perfect here. Of course, we respect the Grand Lama without him, the place would go up in flames. But he's being lied to, or his obsessions are out of touch with the realities of today. I fight for a valley that will have even more freedom, where everyone can access the same chances, where we could actually help the world your world. And... I don't have time to explain everything, the monks are everywhere here.

What I know: Brother Wilfried keeps an important document in a secret room near the library. Because he needs you for his plans at the ceremony tomorrow, you are welcome there. It is our only chance to change the power forces in the valley. We, the people, need to get a hold of what's hidden in this room.

Please, do not escape. Surrender to a monk, go back to your quarters. Please, go. You don't have a lot of time until he moves you out of the palace. You need to identify which of the many doors on that floor is the one to that secret room and how to open it. I've received intel that you'll find all you need in the library! Please, your success holds the key to our rebellion.

My name is Li-Tsen, and my people rely entirely on you. If you do this for us, I promise we will help you go back to your lives in the outside world. And you'll be forever known as heroes around here. Forever."


The woman's words spill like fire, and Carlotta just stands there, caught between irritation and awe. Who is this woman? That voice it carries the kind of conviction Carlotta has never had, not even on stage.

Then, a flash of movement a monk spots Li-Tsen and shouts.
She bolts from the shed, swift as a shadow. The monk gives chase, but she's faster.
Gone.
Carlotta exhales, relieved for this woman she just met.

Then she realizes that this rebel just took her one chance to escape.

And yet... she can't shake the sting of admiration.
That fire. That impossible courage to stand for something.

She glances at the others.
She could denounce Li-Tsen, punish her for robbing her of this escape. It could earn the monks' trust, too.
Or should they keep secret what she said and go back? Risk everything for this woman's ideals?
Carlotta is normally so cynical... but she cannot forget the eyes of that rebel.
What is that stranger doing to her?
What kind of woman is she, suddenly?

Should Carlotta follow her instincts and turn Li-Tsen in?
Or listen to that strange pull in her chest
and choose to help her instead?
