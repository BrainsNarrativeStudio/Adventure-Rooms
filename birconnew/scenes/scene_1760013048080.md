Outside, the storm is merciless.
The seven survivors huddle together against the wind, strangers now allies in adversity.

Conway squints through the blizzard.
He is not an optimistic man.
He knows that in this environment, survival is measured in hours if they are lucky.

He looks at the others: the Indian man, the French helper, the cabaret singer, the businessman, the scientist, and the trembling hostess.
If he helped her earlier, they exchange a sad smile.
So full of life, and about to die on a mountain no one will ever find, Conway thinks.

Then, movement.
At first he thinks he is hallucinating.
Two dark shapes are descending the slope through the snow.
Two Sherpas, wrapped in heavy furs, gesture for the group to follow.

No time for questions.
They obey.

The climb is brutal.
The wind cuts like knives.
Snow up to their waists, hands torn on jagged rocks.
Each step is slower, heavier.

Conway can no longer feel his fingers.
His face burns with frost.
The world shrinks to white and pain.
Somewhere behind, someone screams, a voice carried away by the wind.

He turns.
The hostess is gone.

Conway shouts, leaves the line, stumbling back through the snow, following the faint marks of their trail.
And then he finds her.

She has fallen into a crevasse, half buried in snow, one leg twisted, face pale but breathing.
She tries to speak, but no sound comes out.

Conway kneels beside her.
The group is gone from sight, lost in the storm.

He knows what this means.
He stays with her anyway.
He takes her hand as the snow closes in.
She closes her eyes. She will not die alone.



Narrator (meta):

Oh. Well. That is unfortunate.
It seems our protagonist has expired.
A very promising start, but rather short lived.

Well then, let us try this again, shall we.
We need a new protagonist.

You have met the others:
the Indian gentleman (actually a detective), the French helper, the Austrian cabaret star, the Argentinian businessman, and the Japanese scientist.
