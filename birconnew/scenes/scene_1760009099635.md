Conway rushes to the back of the plane.
The tail groans, the metal twisting above the crevasse.
Snow whirls through the broken hull.

The scientist clings to a beam, one arm stretched toward a leather briefcase sliding inch by inch toward the abyss.

Conway grabs her shoulder.
"Forget it. It's lost."

She jerks free, eyes fixed on the case.
Another crack the tail shifts under their feet.
Conway slips, catches himself on the frame.

She lunges.
He swears, grabs her belt, and drags her back just as the floor gives way.
For a moment they both hang there, breathless, listening to the briefcase vanish into the storm below.

She tears herself free, shaking, furious.
Conway stares at her half in disbelief, half in anger.

He wants to say something, but there's no point.
Some people would rather die than let go.

Outside, the French person is pulling the hostess from the wreck.
Conway steps out after them, snow stinging his face.
He doesn't look back at the scientist, but he can still hear her muttering, already searching the drifts where the briefcase fell.
