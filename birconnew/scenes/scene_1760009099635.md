Conway rushes to the back of the plane.
The tail groans, metal twisting above the crevasse.
Snow whirls through the shattered hull.

Dr. Takeda clings to a beam, one arm stretched toward a large leather bag sliding inch by inch toward the abyss.

Conway grabs her shoulder.
"Forget it! It's gone!"

She moves forward to the bag, risking falling. "No! You don't understand!"
Another crack. The tail tilts beneath them.

Conway catches himself. She lunges towards the bag.
He swears, grabs her by the belt as the floor splits open.

The bag teeters on the edge. Seeing that the scientist risks her life for this damn bag, Conway sees no other solution than to throw himself forward, catch the strap, and drag the bag first, the woman second.

The two of them collapse against the wall, gasping, snow whipping through the wreckage.
Dr. Takeda clutches the bag like a lifeline, shaking with relief.

Conway looks at her furious, bewildered.
"You almost killed us both for a bag."

She doesn't answer. Just hugs it tighter.

Outside, the French activist is pulling the stewardess from the wreck.
Conway steps out after them, snow biting his face.
Behind him, Dr. Takeda follows, the bag pressed tight against her chest as if it's worth more than her own life.
