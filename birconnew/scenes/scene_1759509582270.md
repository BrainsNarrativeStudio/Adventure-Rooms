  The trio of escapees tries to befriend the dogs. The animals, first curious, react well to the open hands and offer of scratches. But as Roy tries to pass them and continue his way; one of the dogs violently snaps and bites his wrist to the bone. Roy screams as he sees his blood pouring out of the wound. Alerted, several monks run from their quarters just next door.

They're caught! These monks seem on edge and unsure what to do, but the characters really have the feeling they should not do anything to anger them. 

Defeated, they follow the monks.
