The trio is back in the library.

The others look up the stewardess, the businessman, the French activist waiting for an explanation, for some hope.
Carlotta hates that look. It feels like judgment, and worse, like pity.

She speaks before anyone can ask.
"There was a woman," she says. "A rebel. She found us outside. Said this place isn't what it seems that Shangri-La's a lie. She asked for our help to find some secret document Wilfried keeps hidden. Something that could change the balance of power here."

The others exchange nervous glances.
Roy lifts his head sharply.
"You believed her?" he asks. "We can't trust anyone here. Not her, not Wilfried, not anyone. You don't know who's watching or what game they're playing."

Carlotta folds her arms.
"And what's your plan then? Just sit here until they decide what to do with us?"

Roy doesn't answer. His jaw tightens.
He drops into a chair, breathing hard. His face is pale, his eyes dark with exhaustion.

(If he was bitten)
The monks patched his wound, but the bandage is already red. He's shaking, breath shallow.

Then his voice cracks.
"My wife..." He stops, breath catching. "She's pregnant."
He presses a hand to his face. "I have to go back to Darjeeling. I can't stay here forever. I don't want to die here."

He breaks shoulders shaking, sobs muffled against his palms.

Carlotta looks away. She can't stand it.
Real emotion always makes her uncomfortable.
And now, to her own disgust, she feels something too confusion, guilt... maybe even excitement when she thinks about that rebel woman.

She stays standing. She doesn't want to explain more.
How could she? That they stopped their escape her escape because some trembling rebel in the shadows begged them for help?
That she, the Black Angel, is now working for someone else's cause?

"It's... a chance," she says finally, though she's not sure for what.
In the meantime, they're trapped again.
Was that really a good decision?

As the others fall silent, Carlotta feels the weight of her own choice pressing down.
She stopped running. For once, she didn't save herself first.
And it terrifies her.

She sits down, exhausted.
She's not made for this "helping others" nonsense.

**It feels we have reached the end of The Black Angel's run as our protagonist.
Let's see who else could step up.**
