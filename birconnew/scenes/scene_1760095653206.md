The trio is back in the library.

The same table. The same books. The same silence.

The others look up the stewardess, the businessman, the French activist waiting for an explanation.
Carlotta hates that look. It feels like judgment, and worse, like pity.

Roy collapses into a chair, face pale and drawn.

The monks patched his wound, but the bandage is already red. He's shaking, breath shallow.

Roy lifts his head, voice breaking.
"My wife... she's pregnant," he says. "I have to go back to Darjeeling. I can't die here."
His shoulders shake. A grown man crying.

Carlotta looks away. She can't watch. Real emotion always makes her uncomfortable.
And now, to her own disgust, she feels something too confusion, and maybe even hope?

She stays standing. She doesn't want to sit. She doesn't want to explain.
How could she? That they stopped their escape her escape because some trembling rebel in the shadows begged them for help?
That she, Carlotta von Schwarz, the Black Angel of Vienna, is now working for someone else's cause?

She finally speaks, telling the others about the rebel and the mission.
"It's... a chance," she says, though she's not sure for what. Freedom? Redemption?
In the meantime, they're trapped again. Was that really a good decision?

As the group absorbs her words, Carlotta feels the weight of her own choice pressing down.
She stopped running. For once, she didn't save herself first.

And it terrifies her.
She sits down, exhausted. She's not made for this "helping others" nonsense.

It feels we have reached the end of The Black Angel's run as our protagonist. Let's see who else could step up.
