You have 5 minutes to get your answer.

The group splits some take charge of talking to the Administrator, while others scan the document for topics and possible angles of attack.

Benicio adjusts his tie, smiling faintly. He knows men like this: all pride, precision, and paranoia. It's only a matter of time before one wrong word pulls a thread loose.

THE GAME

Administrator: Calm. Rational. Courteous. He deflects emotion with logic, turning every accusation into a lesson. He rarely answers directly instead, he tests the group, as if trying to decide whether they could serve as useful allies or double agents. His tone is measured, almost fatherly, but behind the civility, there is calculation.

If three of the five triggers below are mentioned, he loses control and reveals his true intentions: he is leading a faction to overthrow the Grand Lama and take control of Shangri-La.

The Lost Love (emotional)
If the players mention or hint that years ago Kim had a close relationship with one of the outsiders invited by the Grand Lama, it strikes a nerve. That person left the valley, refusing to stay. The rejection shattered Kim's trust in newcomers and made him despise the Lama's policy of openness. He calls it the beginning of corruption.

Administrator: "You know nothing of that," he says sharply, then softens. "She chose the world over wisdom. They always do." (He changes subject, trying to appear unaffected, then suddenly asks:) "Tell me... would you leave if given the chance?"

The Broken Faith (spiritual)
If they mention that Kim removed the engravings or statues of the Sacred Mountain from his office, he tries to dismiss it as renovation. The truth: he no longer feels the Mountain's presence. He believes in people and order, not invisible harmony or symbols.

Administrator: "The Lama prays while I work," he replies dryly. "Faith does not build walls. Men do." (Then, almost casually:) "Do you still believe in the Mountain yourselves? Or have you seen too much of the outside world to believe in myths?"

The Failing Body (physical)
If someone mentions his weakening sight, fatigue, or his new habit of dictating reports, he reacts sharply. He fears losing capacity, being diminished, becoming weak while still alive. He feels time pressing on him, and he wants to secure power before it is taken away.

If pushed, he bursts:

Administrator: "I will not fade while the Lama drifts into dreams!" (Then, catching himself, he smooths his jacket.) "You understand, of course. Time spares no one. How do you plan to stay useful when it comes for you?"

The Hidden Recruits (political)
If they bring up his new guards, transfers, or "special details," he first claims they are security measures. But it's true he has built a loyal network to seize control when the time comes.

If two other triggers are already touched, this one will make him explode.

Administrator: "I protect Shangri-La from itself. Someone must!" (Then, leaning forward:) "Would you do the same, if you knew the world was about to fall apart?"

The Scorn for Art (cultural)
If they mention that he no longer attends readings, concerts, or poetry gatherings, he reacts with contempt. He sees culture as distraction, proof of decay. He thinks Shangri-La wastes its energy on art while the world outside sharpens its weapons.

Administrator: "The Lama builds choirs while the mountains tremble. I build walls." (Then he studies their faces, half-smiling.) "Which would you rather defend beauty or survival?"

WHEN THREE TRIGGERS ARE REACHED: SUCCESS

IF THE TRIGGERS ARE NOT REACHED: FAILURE
