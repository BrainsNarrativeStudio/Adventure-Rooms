Carlotta turns the corner first, confident as always... until she stops dead in her tracks.

Three large dogs stand in the hallway ahead, muscles tense, teeth glinting in the lamplight. Their growls echo off the stone walls.

For once, charm won't help Carlotta here.

{{#has "cheese"}}
Suddenly, the dogs lift their heads, noses twitching. The sharp smell of the cheese in Carlotta's pocket has caught their attention.
Should she take the chance and feed them?
Or back away slowly before they decide it's her they want to taste?
{{/has}}

{{#hasNot "cheese"}}
Carlotta curses under her breath.
The dogs watch every movement, ready to spring.
She weighs her odds: back away and risk them chasing?
Or trust her luck and try to calm them, inching past with a gentle hand and steady voice?
