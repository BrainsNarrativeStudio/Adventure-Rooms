Benicio Torres straightens his collar and studies the others tired, nervous, whispering like lost tourists as the trio who tried to escape reports about their encounter with a rebel and her plea for help to find a secret document.

Benicio, however, feels right at home.
A hidden valley cut off from the world, a society cracking under pressure, rebels in the shadows perfect.
Places in turmoil are places full of opportunity.
And Benicio has made a career out of turning crisis into profit.

Just days ago, he was escaping police across the world after half of Buenos Aires discovered his grand real-estate empire was nothing more than an elaborate pyramid scheme. His name was in every newspaper. His accounts frozen. His "friends" suddenly very busy.

But luck, like Benicio, has a talent for survival.
And now, after a crash in the middle of nowhere, he's found the one thing a man like him needs most: a place where no one knows his name.

He just has to stay calm, smile at the right people, flatter the ones in charge, and never, ever mention the past.

And maybe succeeding here would be the best tribute to that poor chap who died to save him earlier. Conway, wasn't it? A noble fool but still, Benicio owes him that much.

He glances at the towering bookshelves, the gold details glinting in the candlelight.
A library filled with secrets, power, and wealth.
This is his kind of place.

**Candidates! Before the game continues, tell us a bit more about Benicio Torres:**
What is the most expensive gift he ever bought for himself?
He has a health problem. What is it?
Who was his best friend?
What is his go-to drink?
Who is he still in love with?
Where was he really going after Shanghai?


Wilfried enters the room and seems relieved to see the entire group here. He looks at the trio of escapees.

WILFRIED:
"I hope your little... escapade was fun. You could have asked if you wanted to explore already this night... You're not prisoners, you're our guests. For reasons that will become clear later, I believe in you, people.

But... have you... met anyone, while you were... visiting? No? I confess that we've been having some challenges lately. Shangri-La has seen more demonstrations of unsatisfaction. I welcome all critics, but their methods are no good. See, these people don't know the exterior world like you do. They do not know how terrible it can be corruption, violence, war, dictature... and therefore they feel the small faults in our utopia are gigantic problems... But they do not need to act so secretly, creating division. They still respect the Grand Lama, wisely, and the Lama hopes you people can actually help us with all this.

I tell you all this just in case someone tries to get in touch with you with... strange demands.

I have emergencies I need to attend to. The best thing you can do now is rest a few hours. I'll come get you for the ceremony."


As Wilfried leaves, the others exchange worried glances.
Benicio hides his amusement behind a polite smile.

Secrets are currency and this palace seems to overflow with both.

He looks up at the gleaming books and golden ornaments surrounding him.
"Yes," he murmurs, "I could definitely get used to this."

He'd better help the others crack the mysteries of this library if he wants to steal or monetise whatever they find.
