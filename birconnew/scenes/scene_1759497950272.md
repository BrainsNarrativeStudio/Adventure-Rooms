As they approach the building, Carlotta notices more and more children and curious faces watching them from afar, excited. Apparently, foreigners are an attraction here.

She sees that the businessman, so loud and confident on the plane, now looks hollow. He grabs her by the shoulders and exhales, shaking.
"He disappeared. He died to save me. He died to save me."

Carlotta counts the group. One is missing.
Oh, that somber British man. Too bad. Not her type anyway. No fun.

The Sherpa signals the group to gather and stop on a bridge leading to the main door of the palace.

A man wearing a colorful robe, with a thick beard and a warm smile, steps out of the palace and opens his arms to them. Carlotta can't tell his age these religious types always look old, even when they're young.

WILFRIED: "We do not get visitors very often. Welcome to Shangri-La! You certainly have thousands of questions. All will be answered in time."

**Candidates! Tell me:**
- **What is the first question Carlotta would like to ask him?**
- **What would Carlotta rather do right now than listen to that man?**
- **What is Carlotta's most cherished memory?**

WILFRIED: "You can admire the view! Shangri-La is a hidden valley with a perfect climate. It's almost impossible to find, and it would take days of wind and cold to reach any other sign of civilization. We are a lost island but we like it that way. You'll soon understand why."

"I am Brother Wilfried. I'm not in charge, no one really is here. We all follow the teachings of a wise man, the Grand Lama. I am honored to serve as his eyes and ears in our valley. We spend most of our time reading and meditating, like everyone else in the palace."

**Candidates! Tell me:**
- **What is Carlotta's attitude toward Brother Wilfried?**
- **Would Carlotta light a cigarette right now?**
*(Improvise consequences based on their answers.)*

WILFRIED: "We try to live in a fair and open society, where anyone can bring up a problem or suggest change. We live in trust, in freedom. But I'm rambling... You must be starving!"

Wilfried enters the palace through the large wooden doors, guarded by two giant monks.

The survivors, still shocked, shivering, and exhausted, follow him inside and are struck by the calm and elegance of the place. The furniture is made of precious woods and marble, the curtains of fine silk.

They enter a vast library filled with books, maps, and objects from every culture on Earth.

Wilfried gestures for them to sit around a large table, where plates of fruits, delicacies, and dishes Carlotta doesn't recognize are waiting.

WILFRIED: "Everything is vegetarian in Shangri-La. I hope that is alright with you."

*(Points to the real food, offer it to the players.)*
**Please feel free to eat it will help you connect with the protagonist.**
