Carlotta Schwarz, the cabaret dancer called the Black Angel, is used to lights, applause, and silk sheets.
Not this.
Crawling through a snowstorm was not what she imagined when she accepted that invitation to perform in Shanghai.

The mysterious letter had promised the most select club in the East, a month of shows, an easy fortune.
The ticket was paid for, the cheque signed.
A new crowd of rich people on the other side of the world, lusting after her?

That thought is all that keeps her moving.
That and... Something else - Someone else -- that could be in Shanghai.

One painful step, then another.
Her chich boots were also never made for this.

The Sherpas walk ahead, almost invisible.
The wind slowly fades.

Carlotta lifts her head.
They have crossed a ridge, and below lies a valley that should not exist.
Green trees, terraced fields, flowers moving gently in the breeze.
The snow has stopped.

For a moment she thinks she must be hallucinating, about to die.
But the other survivors' exclamations mean they see it too.

At the center of the valley stands a vast building.
A palace, or maybe a monastery.
Golden domes glint above an architecture Carlota cannot place: part oriental, part arabian, part art deco.

Carlotta whispers to herself, almost without sound.
"What is this place?"
