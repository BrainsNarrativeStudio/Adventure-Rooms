The doors open and Brother Wilfried steps inside, looking as if he's interrupting something shameful.

Before anyone else can speak, Benicio steps forward, voice calm, helpful.
"There was a woman," he says, nodding toward the window. "Dressed in black. She came in, said strange things about Shangri-La, and then fled."

Wilfried's face tightens. He barks a few orders, and within moments the courtyard below fills with movement dozens of monks running, torches slicing through the night.

Benicio joins the others at the window.
There Li-Tsen. Caught just before reaching the gates.
From up here, her face is a storm of rage.
"How could you do this? I don't know what the Lama sees in you!"
Two monks seize her arms and drag her away into the dark.

Silence.
The others look shaken, ashamed.

Benicio watches her disappear and has trouble refraining a smile.
Nice, he thinks. For once, it's someone else being arrested.
