The monk at the north gate stands perfectly still, eyes fixed ahead.
Focused. Too focused.

Carlotta slows her step. One wrong move and he'll raise the alarm.
She tilts her head, studying him calm, stoic, disciplined. The kind of man who's probably never spoken to a woman like her before.

Maybe she could use that. A smile, a whisper, a little charm... It wouldn't be the first time she's used her powers.
But there are other ways too: a quick distraction, a clever lie, a show of confidence, or simply slipping past in the shadows.

**Candidates it's up to you. You have one minute to deal with this monk, in the shoes of Carlotta. What do you do?**
*(DO NOT GIVE THEM THE OPTION CHOICES YET, LET THEM IMAGINE AND RPG)*
