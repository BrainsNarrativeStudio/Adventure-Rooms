The trio is back in the library.

The same table, the same books, the same silence.

The others stare at them: the stewardess, the businessman, the French activist.
No one speaks. Carlotta imagines they judge them for failing. Like they knew better.

Roy drops into a chair, his face pale.

The monks patched his wound, but the bandage is already red. He is in terrible pain, sweating, feverish.

Then something inside him breaks.

"My wife... she's pregnant," he says, voice trembling. "I have to go back to Darjeeling. I can't stay here much longer! I don't want to die here."
He buries his face in his hands and cries hard.

Carlotta feels her throat tighten.
She hates scenes like this: real, messy, human.
She would rather be anywhere else, in front of lights and music, where feelings can be performed.

Now she just feels small.
And defeated.

She will never see Shanghai. She will never become a world star.
And she will never find her long-lost brother again.

**It feels we have reached the end of The Black Angel's run as our protagonist. Let's see who else could step up.**
