title: Failure Wilfried ending
set:
---

Carlotta and Benicio exchange a look the first honest one they've shared.
No clever words left, no plans to spin. Just two people who thought they could outsmart everyone, and failed.

Brother Wilfried watches them, voice calm but heavy.

WILFRIED:
"I had such hopes for you.
When the Grand Lama spoke of the ones who would come,
I thought he meant people ready to see beyond themselves.
But maybe I was wrong.
Maybe the Mountain has lost its faith in us all.

You deserve to know the truth anyway.
The crash that brought you here was not an accident.
You were chosen.
Each of you was found for what you could bring to Shangri-La.
Artists, scientists, dreamers, believers.
We hoped you would understand...
Four centuries ago, a priest from Luxembourg, Father Perrault, crossed the world.
He found this valley and discovered what others only dreamed of.
He built Shangri-La as a refuge, a memory of humankind.
And he is still alive.
The Grand Lama you were meant to meet is that same man
four hundred years old, keeper of our secret,
and of all that remains good in this world.

You were meant to prove yourselves.
To show that you were worthy to carry this legacy forward.
But now I do not know.
Maybe I made a mistake.
Maybe none of us are worthy."

Benicio almost laughs quietly, bitterly.
Four hundred years old. And still running a con.
Carlotta wants to believe, for once. But this all seems impossible.

Then, Administrator Kim enters, flanked by monks.

ADMINISTRATOR:
"It is over.
The Grand Lama has been found dead in his chambers. Murdered.
And these outsiders were seen near the restricted wings.
It has to be them."

WILFRIED:
"What are you saying? The Grand Lama? Dead? But one of them is the..."

ADMINISTRATOR:
"Take them. All of them."

**Will these charcaters manage to prove their innocence by finding the killer?**
**Will they prove their worth to Shangri-La? Will they reveive eternal life?**

**You will be able to continue the story yourself, next year, in the full BRAINSCAPE.**
