The safe opens with a long, rusty creak, a puff of dust rising like a sigh from the past.

Benicio leans forward, heart pounding. This is it. The treasure. The payoff.

But inside no diamonds, no gold bars, no relics glowing with power.
Just a single piece of paper, folded in four.

One of the others picks it up carefully and unfolds it.
A mess of numbers, strange symbols, and little hand-drawn flowers.

Benicio blinks, waiting for the trick, the hidden compartment, the real prize.
Nothing.

He stares at the page, completely lost.
"That's it?" he mutters. "You've got to be kidding me."
