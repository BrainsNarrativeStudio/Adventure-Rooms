Carlotta backs away, every step measured, eyes locked on the dogs.
Her heel scrapes against the stone. A growl deepens.
Detective Roy reacts fast, grabbing her arm and pulling her around the corner just as the dogs lunge forward.
The trio runs down the staircase, breathless.

They emerge into a vast stone courtyard bathed in moonlight.
The air is sharp and still, the snow on the surrounding peaks glittering under the pale sky.
For a moment, even Carlotta is struck by the beauty then reality snaps back: they're fugitives, not tourists.

She scans the courtyard. Two exits. Two monks.

EXIT LEFT: A solemn monk guards the north gate. He's motionless, silent, almost statuesque. The wooden leg might explain why he's standing so still.

EXIT RIGHT: A thin, bony monk sits hunched on a stool before the east gate, talking to himself in a fast rhythm. His eyes dart from shadow to shadow.

Carlotta whispers, more to herself than the others,
"Do we face the good soldier or gamble on the madman?"

**Which one of the two guards should Carlotta face? Which one might allow a smooth escape?**
