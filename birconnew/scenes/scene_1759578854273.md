Carlotta approaches the monk guarding the east gate.
He's mumbling to himself, rocking slightly, eyes darting between shadows.

After ten years in Berlin nightlife, Carlotta thinks, he's not even in the top ten of the most unhinged men I've met.

The monk suddenly straightens up.
"How can I know I can trust them?
Maybe they're enemies...
Maybe they're ghosts...
No, no, no, I should ask them questions!
Yes! That's the only way to be sure I can trust them!"

He points at the trio with manic enthusiasm.
"Alright, strangers! Answer me YES or NO!
If you answer wrong twice... well, I'll have no choice but to arrest you."

Carlotta exhales, glancing at Roy and Takeda.
Perfect. A trust-issue monk running a quiz at midnight. Why not?

**The Monk's Game**

*(If one wrong answer:)*
"Ha! They answered wrong! One more mistake and I'll stop you!"

*(If two wrong:)*
He gasps and points triumphantly.
"Two mistakes! That's it! You can't be trusted!" (He arrests the players.)

*Questions:*
Are you allowed to be here? (NO)
Do you think I should let you go? (YES)
Am I the best guard? (NO)
Would arresting you be good for my career? (YES)
Was there chicken for lunch? (NO)

*If failure: Arrest!*

*(If only one wrong at the end:)*
The monk sighs, nodding slowly.
"Hm... maybe you are trustworthy after all. You can go."
Carlotta smirks. She did it, she led the trio to freedom!
