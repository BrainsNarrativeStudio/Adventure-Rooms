Conway opens his eyes.
His head throbs.
Everything is cold, white, unreal.

Snow pours through a wide crack in the fuselage.
The smell of smoke mixes with fuel and metal.
The only sound is the wind howling through the wreck.

He moves slowly, checks his arms and legs.
Still alive. Somehow.

The cockpit door hangs open.
Inside, the pilot a surprisingly old Asian man is dead.

Conway looks around.
The Indian man is bruised but conscious, trying to stand.
The French person is already helping the cabaret singer, who cries but breathes.
The businessman crawls out from under a broken seat, coat torn but intact.
Most others lie still.

Then Conway notices the smoke.
Fuel drips from a cracked pipe near the left wing.

Within seconds, the fire spreads.
The heat pushes back the snow.

A scream cuts through the wind.
The hostess.
She is pinned under a twisted seat, blood on her leg, snow and smoke hitting her face through the broken fuselage.
The flames are moving toward her.

Conway starts forward but another shout stops him.

At the back of the plane, the Japanese scientist clings to a tilted floor beam.
Her briefcase has slid down near the open tail, which hangs over a crevasse, creaking dangerously.
She is trying to reach it, refusing to let it fall.

Conway freezes.
He can only reach one of them in time.

The hostess trapped, bleeding, fire closing in.
Or the scientist hanging above the void, desperate to recover something she will not abandon.

Your first test.
Your first vote.

Here, white means help the hostess.
Black means help the scientist.

You can discuss. Debate between you apprentices.

Make yours count.
