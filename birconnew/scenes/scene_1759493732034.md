Conway opens his eyes.
His head throbs.
Everything is cold, white, unreal.

Snow pours through a wide crack in the fuselage.
The only sound is the wind howling through the wreck.

He moves slowly, checks his arms and legs.
Unharmed. Somehow.

The cockpit door hangs open.
Inside, the pilot, a surprisingly old Asian man, is dead.
Conway has a moment of clarity, and jumps to the radio to send an SOS. 
But some sparks of electricity shows that the radio is broken. 
Maybe he could repair it?

**Is our protagonist a skilled repairman? Candidates, of of you should try to help and see if he could repair that radio circuit. Find here a small electronic puzzle. You have two minutes to repair it.**
