Benicio steps forward before anyone else can react.
He glances at the others still hesitating then grabs the chair without a word.

One sharp motion.
The chair crashes into the mirror.

The glass shatters with a long, sliding sound, a slow rain of silver dust falling to the floor.

Behind it, hidden in the wall, stands a metal safe.
Old. Heavy. Its surface carved with the same mountain range the peaks descending from high to low.

Where the lock should be, there's a row of alphabetical wheels.
The code requires as many letters as there are of them.

For a moment, no one moves.
The echo of breaking glass still trembles through the palace walls.

Benicio exhales, almost smiling.
"Well," he says softly, "no turning back now."

Whatever secret this room holds, they have to find it fast.

**You have two minutes to figure out and tell me the code.**

*(After one minute, if needed, the narrator may add: "The carved mountains seem to descend in order... Perhaps the code follows the same path.")*
