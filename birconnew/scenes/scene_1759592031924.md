Carlotta is the first to scream.
"Here! Over here!"

The words slice the air too loud, too late to take back.
Monks rush in, lanterns flaring, surrounding them.

Li-Tsen freezes. Their eyes meet both women too proud to look away.
The rebel's face hardens into a grimace.
"How could you do this? I don't know what the Lama sees in you."

Two monks seize her and drag her into the dark.
Silence follows.

Carlotta stands still, breath uneven.
It was the smart choice survival, nothing more.
But it feels hollow, like stepping off a stage after the applause has died.

She hides her trembling hands in her coat and forces a faint smile.
"Well," she says, "let's not keep Brother Wilfried waiting."

The group follows a guard back inside.
Carlotta walks ahead, head high, her shadow long and fragile on the stone.

She has saved herself and somehow lost something. The will to go on.
The others look to her for answers.
She leans against the wall for a moment, unable to speak.

**It feels we have reached the end of The Black Angel's run as our protagonist.
Let's see who else could step up.**
