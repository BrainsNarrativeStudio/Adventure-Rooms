Administrator Kim leans back in his chair, unimpressed.
"You are wasting my time. Next time, bring something useful to the table."

Benicio forces a polite smile, though his throat burns.

For a moment, the room feels smaller.
He hears another voice his father's.
"You're good for nothing, Benicio. Do you think you look like a winner?"

He cannot keep losing. Not again. Not here.

As he leaves the room, his reflection in the polished marble looks like someone he no longer recognizes.

Outside, the others wait in silence. No one dares to speak first.
They all feel it: the humiliation, the confusion.
They crash in a paradise, become prisoners, betray a woman, and now fail their only mission.
They look like fools, and they know it. Benicio more than all.

They find Wilfried soon after and report what little they have.
No clear proof. No confession. Nothing useful.

Wilfried sighs deeply.
WILFRIED: "I'm sure you did your best. For reasons that will become clear later, I believe in you, people. The best thing you can do now is rest a few hours. I'll come get you."

The group nods, trying to hide their shame.
Those last words I believe in you spark something faint in Benicio. A fragile ember.
Words he's never heard before.

He glances around the library: the carved shelves, the locked doors, the golden details glinting in the firelight.
If every door is closed, then maybe it's time to open one that isn't meant to be.

He turns to Carlotta, lowering his voice.
"What exactly did that rebel woman say," he asks, "about the room? And the document?"

Carlotta hesitates, then, seeing in the Argentinian businessman a glimmer of purpose, repeats the words softly.

Benicio smiles, eyes narrowing.
"Rest," he mutters. "Sure."
