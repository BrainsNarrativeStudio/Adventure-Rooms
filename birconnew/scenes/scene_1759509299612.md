The kid wakes up, still half in his dream.

"Oh. What? Are you... the dragon slayers??"

It's another challenge! You have one minute to tell him a story to make him think he's still sleeping, and that the characters are the dragon slayers of his dream...

If great story: the kid falls back asleep... Phew. The group exits the room.

If the story is lackluster: the kid wakes up totally "Hey, who are you??" and screams.
