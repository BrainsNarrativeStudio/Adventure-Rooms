Alerted, three monks, quite tall and not talking, run towards the group in the hallway.

Carlotta and Arun look at one another. No way they're letting themselves getting captured. They start running. The poor Miss Takeda, still carrying her bag, tries to keep the distance.

**Challenge!**
Look at this card. Can Carlotta escape the guard? Let's see how this pans out... Shuffle the deck of destiny! And reveal the cards one by one...
