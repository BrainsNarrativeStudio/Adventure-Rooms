The snow storm outside is doubling down, the shell of the plane is about to get recovered and the survivors entombed.

The cold becomes unbrerable. All the charcaters gather to keep each other warm, but as the night falls, they slowly fall into an eternal slumber.


The characters wake up, all in the same room, a sort of makeshift hospital in a temple. The sun is almost setting. How much time has passed?

The group has been saved and apparently brought to a city. In the middle of the Himalayas? How is that possible?

Nurses and doctors speaking a mix of languages are tending to the weakest of the group, relieved to see them waking up and talking A doctor tells them it's extremely lucky they're all alive -- and with all their limbs intact.

Why didn't they follow the guide that was sent to their rescue?

Are they ready to meet with soemeone that will explain what this place is?

The nurses help you get up and get ready. You are brought to a big building overseeing the valley below, something like a palace or an imposing monastery, with golden domes on top of towers and an architecture you cannot place; mixing oriental, arabic and art-deco europen influences. From up there you sees that the trees are green and the moutain sides are covered with cultures and flowers.
