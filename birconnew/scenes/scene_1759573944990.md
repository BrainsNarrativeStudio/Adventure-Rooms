Carlotta freezes as the curtains in the next room fly open.
All three of them react at once, pressing themselves flat against the cold wall, barely daring to breathe.

Through the narrow gap, Carlotta glimpses the outline of a tall, thin man. His movements are slow, controlled. He peers out for a moment, scanning the balcony.

Then, apparently satisfied, he lets the curtain fall back into place.

Carlotta finally exhales, a breath she didn't know she was holding. Whoever that man is, he radiates authority and danger.

She nods to the others and slips quietly into the dark bedroom.
