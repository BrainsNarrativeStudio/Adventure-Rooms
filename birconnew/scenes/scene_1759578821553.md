Carlotta steps into the vast, chaotic kitchen first, followed closely by Roy and Takeda.

Steam clouds her vision. Fires roar beneath heavy woks. The air is thick with the smell of garlic, ginger, and butter dizzying and rich.
Cooks rush past, shouting, stirring, chopping, slamming lids shut. No one even glances their way.

Perfect.
Carlotta moves quickly, weaving between tables and baskets, her heels silent now. Roy follows close, tense and alert, while Takeda keeps her head low, clutching that damned bag.

They're almost through when a small voice cuts through the noise.
"Excuse me... could you please help me?"

Carlotta freezes.
At the far corner of the room, an old cook sits hunched over a table covered in tiny bowls of powders and herbs. His hands tremble, his eyes milky with age.

"I heard you passing by," he says. "You sound less busy than the others. I've mixed up all my spices and I can't tell them apart anymore. My senses... they fail me. Please, help me fix this."

Carlotta exhales through her nose. Another delay.
But the man looks so frail she can't quite bring herself to ignore him.


**Challenge! You have two minutes to identify the spices.**

*If they SUCCEED:*

The old cook beams.
"Oh, thank you, my friends! You saved my recipe. Please, take this a marvelous little French cheese we've kept for years."

Carlotta smirks, takes the cheese, and slips it into her coat pocket.
The cook hums to himself, mixing the spices again as they slip quietly out of the kitchen.

*If they FAIL:*

They know they've mixed something wrong.
The old man still smiles faintly.
"Thank you for helping me," he murmurs, not seeing the mistake.

Carlotta hurries the others out.
Moments later, behind them, a distant cry echoes through the clatter:
"Oh no... no, no! I ruined my recipe! Nooooo!"
