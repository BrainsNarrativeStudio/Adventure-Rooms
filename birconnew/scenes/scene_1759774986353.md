This is now a story of betrayal and double agents.

Benicio Torres speaks for the group. It's what he does best.
"We found nothing conclusive, Brother. The Administrator was polite, but careful. Nothing to report."

Wilfried studies them for a moment, his gaze lingering on each face, too long to be comfortable. Then he exhales, long and tired.

WILFRIED: "It's okay. I'm sure you did your best. For reasons that will become clear later, I believe in you, people. The best thing you can do now is rest a few hours. I'll come get you."

The door closes behind him. A nervous shiver runs through the group.
They just lied to a monk in paradise.
The thrill of it hangs in the air like static.

The French activist turns toward Dr. Takeda, who's still red with nerves.
Then, quickly, behind a bookshelf, they kiss a small, clumsy kiss to calm a fear and say we're in this together.
They think no one noticed.
Benicio did. Of course he did.
At least some people here are also having fun.

He looks around the library.
So this is where the rebel's clue leads. And by following it, they'll be doing the Administrator's work.
It's all a mess of shifting loyalties, and everyone's motivations are blurry at best.

But for Benicio, it's not complicated.
"There's a treasure to find," he says. "Let's get cracking."
