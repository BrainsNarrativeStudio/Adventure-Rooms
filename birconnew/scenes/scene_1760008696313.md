Conway throws himself forward through the smoke.
The heat bites his face.
He pulls at the twisted seat once, twice until it gives.

He drags the hostess free.
Cold air rushes in as they fall together into the snow outside.

For a moment they just breathe, shivering, faces close.
Her hand stays in his a little longer than needed.
Their eyes lock a flicker of warmth, gone as fast as it came.

Her voice is hoarse.
"I thought it was over."

Conway nods. "Not yet."

She manages a faint smile, then looks away.
Behind them, the French person is helping the Japanese scientist climb out of the tail section.
She passes Conway, clutching her briefcase, and gives him a hard, unreadable look before limping off into the wind.

Conway watches her go, snow catching in his hair.
Two lives saved and already, the storm rising around them.
