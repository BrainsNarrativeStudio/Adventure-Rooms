The group descends the marble staircase, their footsteps echoing through the dim corridor.

The mood is tense. They whisper like conspirators before a heist, debating strategy in low voices.
How are they going to tackle this mission?

Benicio clears his throat.
"If I may," he says smoothly, "I've talked my way out of worse."
No one argues. It's clear who will do the talking.

Behind him, the French activist murmurs softly to Dr. Takeda. The Japanese scientist, still pale from exhaustion after their failed escape, leans closer, her voice barely audible. Benicio catches the tone, if not the words. A fragile intimacy blooming in the middle of chaos. It almost makes him smile. Even in paradise, people find time for drama. Good for them.

He focuses back on the task.
Two ways to play the game.

They could take the direct route, confront the Administrator outright, demand to know where his loyalties lie.
But Benicio will prefer to go the subtler way, use the intel at their disposal to provoke him, to make him slip. To never mention these intel directly to the Administrator.

Benicio opens the file and glances at the others.
"Find me some dirt on that guy, everyone has a secret in their past. Don't you think?"
