The group slowly walks down the stairs. 

The mood is tense, as they're debatting strategy.

How are they going to tackle this mission? 

They could go the direct way, blatantly ask the administrator about his allegiance, defy him. 

Or they could try a more covert way, trying to ally themselves with the Administrator. Make him believe you're ready to betray Wilfried.

You have 3 minutes to figure out a strategy before meeting the administrator. 

Your goal is to get a clear answer: is he a traitor to the Grand Lama?
