Administrator:
"Enough! Yes, I am gathering men. Yes, I will act.
The Grand Lama has lost the world.
Wilfried drowns us in music while the walls crack.
Shangri-La is rotting under their faith in poetry and peace.
I will not watch it die.
I will take command, restore order, and build a city that survives.
Call it treason if you want. I call it duty."

After this, Kim steadies himself, breathing hard.
He does not regret it.
He feels liberated.

Benicio leans back against the wall, satisfied. Proud, looking around if the others are giving him enough praises.

The Administator takes a deep breath

Administrator:
"You have no idea what more I can offer you. There is a treasure that Wilfried and the Grand Lama protect, more incredible that you can imagine. It's obvious you were sent here by Wilfried to spy on me, that's a smart move. But here is a smarter move for you: keep Brother Wilfried's trust and use your access to get something for me in his secret room. A precious document he hides in a safe there. I neeed it. You don't need to know why. What you need to know is that if you succeed and bring me that document, not only I'll help you go back to the world, but you will be the most powerful people on Earth.

Go. We don't have much time. Betraying me won't lead you anywhere. Wilfried has no idea how many of his monks joined my ranks. But allying with me can bring you everything. Go now. Find which door hides the secret room, find a way to enter. Open his safe. Do it for yourselves."

The group climbs the stairs in silence. Benicio can almost hear the gears turning in their heads.

Two strategies, both tempting.
Tell Wilfried that Kim is a traitor, and they become the perfect guests, trusted and protected. But that's a position that might not last.
Or play the other side: follow what the rebel and the Administrator both hinted at, and steal that secret document. Dangerous, yes, but they would have something tangible up their sleeve.

He glances back at the others, all frowning like students before an exam.
"You're about to make the wrong choice, aren't you? You people are not ready for any of this."

Suddenly, out of nowhere, the stewardess slaps him. Hard, dry, leaving a red mark on his cheek. If he'd been smoking, the cigar would've gone flying down the stairs.

The young stewardess looks him dead in the eyes.
"You have no idea who we are, what we're capable of, and what we know. Remember this."

The corrupt businessman is almost impressed. If only that last line hadn't sounded so much like a threat.
What does this girl know?

But first things first: what to tell Wilfried?

**What should Torres and the group report back to Wilfried? Tell him the truth about the Administrator's coup project? Or pretend they didn't find anything conclusive, so they can still try to steal that secret document?**
