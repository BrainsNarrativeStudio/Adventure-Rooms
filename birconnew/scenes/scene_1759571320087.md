Benicio Torres straightens his collar and watches the others exhausted, shaken, still processing what just happened.

He, on the other hand, feels something entirely different: opportunity.

A hidden valley, untouched by the outside world. No police, no banks, no angry investors. But obviously, a lot of gold and a population that still seems to believe in words like "trust."

Just days ago, he was escaping police across the world after half of Buenos Aires discovered his grand real-estate empire was nothing more than an elaborate pyramid scheme. His name was in every newspaper. His accounts frozen. His friends suddenly very busy.

But luck, like Benicio, has a talent for survival.
And now, after a crash in the middle of nowhere, he's found the one thing a man like him needs most: a place where no one knows his name.

He just has to stay calm, smile at the right people, flatter the ones in charge and never, ever mention the past.

Maybe he won't need to return to the outside world after all. Maybe Shangri-La is exactly what he's been searching for a place to start over, rewrite his story, and this time, get it right.

And then, the window opens.

A woman dressed in black slips inside, her face half-covered, her voice urgent.

REBEL LEADER:
"Oh, thank the Mountain! You're back here! I was not you. Please, listen to me.

A lot of people in our valley need your help. I don't know what you already know about Shangri-La... But it's a lie not everything is perfect here. Of course, we respect the Grand Lama; without him, the place would go up in flames. But he's being lied to, or his obsessions are out of touch with the realities of today. I fight for a valley that will have even more freedom, where everyone can access the same chances, where we could actually help the world. Your world.

And... I don't have time to explain everything, the monks are everywhere here.

What I know: Brother Wilfried keeps an important document in a secret room near the library. Because he needs you for his plans at the ceremony tomorrow, you are welcomed there. It is our only chance to change the power forces in the valley. We, the people, need to get a hold of what's hidden in this room.

Please act fast. You don't have much time until they move you out of the palace. You need to identify which of the many doors on that floor leads to that secret room and how to open it. I received intel that you'll find all you need in the library! Please, your success holds the key to our rebellion.

My name is Li-Tsen, and my people rely entirely on you. If you do this for us, I promise we will help you go back to your lives in the outside world. And you'll be forever known as heroes around here. Forever. We'll be in touch."

Scared by a noise at the door, the woman gracefully jumps out of the window...

Silence.

The words of the fierce woman echo in Benicio's mind.
He smiles faintly to himself, adjusting his cufflinks.
"Well," he murmurs, "it seems destiny just delivered us a business proposal."

A secret room. An important document. Power changing hands?
She spoke of freedom but he heard something else: leverage.

Or maybe denouncing her would be the perfect opportunity to befriend the big boss around here.

Apprentices! Should Benicio listen to Li-Tsen's plea and accept her secret mission, hoping for leverage or denounce her to the monks and secure his own safety?
