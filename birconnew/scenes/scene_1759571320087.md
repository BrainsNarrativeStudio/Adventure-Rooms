Benicio Torres straightens his collar and watches the others exhausted, shaken, still processing what just happened.

He, on the other hand, feels something entirely different: opportunity.

A hidden valley, untouched by the outside world. No police, no banks, no angry investors. But obviously, a lot of gold and a population that still seems to believe in words like "trust."

Just days ago, he was escaping police across the world after half of Buenos Aires discovered his grand real-estate empire was nothing more than an elaborate pyramid scheme. His name was in every newspaper. His accounts frozen. His friends suddenly very busy.

But luck, like Benicio, has a talent for survival.
And now, after a crash in the middle of nowhere, he's found the one thing a man like him needs most: a place where no one knows his name.

He just has to stay calm, smile at the right people, flatter the ones in charge and never, ever mention the past.

Maybe he won't need to return to the outside world after all. Maybe Shangri-La is exactly what he's been searching for a place to start over, rewrite his story, and this time, get it right.

And maybe, succeeding here would be the best tribute to give to that poor chap who died to save him earlier. Conway, wasn't it? A noble fool, but still Benicio owes him that much.

**Candidates! Let's learn more about our charming fugitive:**
- What is the most expensive gift Benicio ever bought for himself?
- Who was his best friend and how did that friendship end?
- What drink does he always order, no matter where he is?
- Who is he still secretly in love with?
- And where was he really planning to go after Shanghai?

*(Reward Story Points for the most deliciously scandalous or telling answers.)*

And then, the window opens.

A woman dressed in black slips inside, her face half-covered, her voice urgent.

REBEL LEADER:
"Oh, thank the Mountain! You're here! Don't be scared, listen to me.

The people of the valley need your help. I don't know what you already know about Shangri-La... But it's a lie, not everything is perfect here. Of course, we respect the Lama, without him the place would go up in flames. But he's being lied to, or his obsessions are getting the best of him and he lost sight of what really matters. I am committed to giving everyone the same freedom, to making sure we all have the same chances; this way we could actually help the world. Your world. And... Ah, I don't have time to explain everything, the monks are everywhere.

This is what I know: Brother Wilfried keeps an important document in a secret room near the library. Because he needs you for his plans at the ceremony tomorrow, you can access the inner sanctum. This means that you are our only chance to change the balance of power in the valley. We, the people, need to get a hold of that document to be free.

Please act fast. You don't have a lot of time before he makes you leave the palace. You need to identify which of the many doors on that floor is the one that leads to that secret room, and you must figure out how to open it. My intel says that a password is hidden in the library, and then this should help you find the right room (give paper). Your success holds the key to our rebellion!

Before we part: my name is Li-Tsen, and now that you're here, all our efforts depend on you. If you do this for us, I promise we will help you go back to your lives out there. And you'll be forever known here as heroes. As heroes. (hears a sound) Oh, they're coming... I'll be in touch."

The words of the fierce woman echo in Benicio's mind.
He smiles faintly to himself, adjusting his cufflinks.

"Well," he murmurs, "it seems destiny just delivered us a business proposal."

A secret room. An important document. Power changing hands?
She spoke of freedom but he heard something else: leverage.

Or maybe denouncing her would be the perfect opportunity to befriend the big boss around here.

Apprentices! Should Benicio listen to Li-Tsen's plea and accept her secret mission, hoping for leverage or denounce her to the monks and secure his own safety?
