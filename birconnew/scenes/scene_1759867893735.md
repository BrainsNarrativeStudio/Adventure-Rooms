Before anyone can move, the door bursts open.
Brother Wilfred runs inside, breathless.
Two monks follow.

WILFRIED: The Grand Lama has been found dead in his chambers. Murdered.

He stops, seeing the group and the paper in Kims hands.
For a moment, he looks heartbroken, then his eyes fill with fear.

WILFRIED: No. This cannot be.

ADMINISTRATOR: I understand now. It has already happened.
And these outsiders were found here, handling the forbidden paper.
It has to be them. They killed our Grand Lama.
Take them. All of them.

Monks run to circle the courtyard.
Nowhere to go.

Will the group manage to prove their innocence by finding the killer? Will they become immortal?

You will be able to do it yourself next year in the full BRAINSCAPE!
