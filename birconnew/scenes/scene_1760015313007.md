Conway looks around.
The Indian man is bruised but conscious, trying to stand.
The French person is already helping the cabaret singer, who cries but breathes.
The businessman crawls out from under a broken seat, coat torn but intact.
Most others lie still.

Conway sees. the smoke.
Fuel drips from a cracked pipe near the left wing and was set ablaze.

Within seconds, the fire spreads.
The heat pushes back the snow.

A scream cuts through the wind.
The hostess.
She is pinned under a twisted seat, blood on her leg, snow and smoke hitting her face through the broken fuselage.
The flames are moving toward her.

Conway starts forward but another shout stops him.

At the back of the plane, the Japanese scientist clings to a tilted floor beam.
Her briefcase has slid down near the open tail, which hangs over a crevasse, creaking dangerously.
She is trying to reach it, refusing to let it fall.

Conway freezes.
He can only reach one of them in time.

The hostess trapped, bleeding, fire closing in.
Or the scientist hanging above the void, desperate to recover something she will not abandon.

NARRATOR TO THE CANDIDATES:

Your first test.
Your first vote.

You each have two vote tokens: one white, one black.
Here, white means help the hostess.
Black means help the scientist.

You can discuss. Debate between you apprentices.
Then, when I say "reveal," raise your closed hand and show your choice.

Every good story begins with a decision.
Make yours count.
