Carlotta stops at a landing dimly lit by flickering oil lamps.

Two paths.

To the left, a narrow staircase winds downward into darkness. The air rising from below is colder, sharper. She can almost smell the outside snow, stone, and risk. Maybe it leads to freedom... or to guards waiting at the exit.

Straight ahead, the hallway bends out of sight. From there comes a faint metallic rattle, then a low, throaty growl. Dogs. More than one. The kind kept to guard, not to pet.

Carlotta hesitates. Her fingers brush the stone railing.
Down, there might be a way out.
Forward, there might be answers. Or teeth.

**Which path will she take?**
