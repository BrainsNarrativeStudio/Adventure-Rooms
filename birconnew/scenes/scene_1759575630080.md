The dogs are too busy devouring the cheese to care about them passing through.
Their tails wag as they eat finally, some real friends in this cursed place, Carlotta thinks.

At the end of the hallway, two monks cross from one doorway to another, murmuring quiet prayers.
Carlotta freezes. The monks' quarters. Right into the lion's jaws...

Just as she's about to head for the stairs, a voice drifts from a half-open door loud and complaining:

"We're monks, not guards! I don't know what's happening up there, but my poor men aren't made for this.
The ones in the courtyard? One's completely mad, muttering about trust!
The other fine guard, yes but he's got a wooden leg, and he nods off the moment someone starts singing!
We're not built for violence in Shangri-La this is a valley of peace!"

Carlotta raises an eyebrow. Even paradise has its gossip.
She gestures for Roy and Takeda to follow.
They've heard enough. Time to move.

The trio slips quietly down the stairs toward the courtyard.
