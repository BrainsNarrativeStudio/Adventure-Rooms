The group can now safely pass as the dogs are eating the cheese and now see these foreigners are their new best friends.

At the end of the hallway, two monks cross from one room to the other. Sounds of prayers. The group realises that this hallway is the monks' quarters... They should not stay long here.

But before leaving down the stairs, the characters hear the voice of an Abbot complaining:

"We're just monks! We're not guards. I don't know what's happening up there, but my poor men are not made for this. Like, the guys in the courtyard: one is really weird, talking to himself about his trust issues! The other one is a great guard despite his wooden leg... But he falls asleep as soon as he hears singing! And we sing a lot as monks! We're not made to be tough people in Shangri-La, this is a valley of peace!"

The group heard enough, they safely climbs down the stairs to the courtyard.
