This is a kid's room.

He's still sleeping.

The group tries to be as discreet as possible while crossing toward the main door.

Carlotta tiptoes, careful not to make a sound.
She smirks to herself she's had plenty of practice sneaking out of bedrooms at night.

They reach the door.
It's old, the wood creaking, the lock stubborn.

Can Carlotta manage to open it without waking the child?

**This is a challenge. You must pick one of you to be the challenger. You have to successfully follow the line without a noise. You are allowed three faults. If you fail a fourth time, you will wake up the kid.**
