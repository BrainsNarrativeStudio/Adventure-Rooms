Welcome. Thanks for joining us.

We are part of a secret guild of storytellers, the Narrators.
We live to discover and tell again the best stories in the universe.
Stories that must be experienced again and again, kept alive.

But some stories are elusive. Complex.
Full of secrets, passion, conflicting morals, and visions of the world.
Like this one.
We are still not sure how it should end, or who should win.

That is why we need your help.
Today, you are passing your Apprentice Appraisal, the test that will decide if you are fit to join our ranks, and maybe one day become a Narrator yourself.

This will be graded.
Your goal is to earn as many Story Points as possible.
At the end, only one apprentice here will stand out as the most promising storyteller of this session.
But every score will be added to the Guild's records, alongside all those who came before.

You can earn Story Points by filling your Appraisal Sheet.
Each of you has received a different sheet, asking you to push the story and its characters in a specific direction, sometimes clashing with the goals of the other apprentices.
Show us how much you can influence the story to fit your assignment.

Because a true Narrator does more than watch.
When the story blurs, when every path is still possible, we must push the narration in the best direction.
When a character faces a difficult choice, we must sometimes step in, speak in their place, solve their riddle, or find the right action to move the story forward.

Do it well, and you will earn extra Story Points for your active participation, offering your imagination and courage.

Every story can take many paths.
Yours begins now.
