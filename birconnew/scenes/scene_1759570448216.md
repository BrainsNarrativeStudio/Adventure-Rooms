Carlotta stops running. They're safe for now. The monks are nowhere in sight.

They find themselves in a long, dim service hallway.

Ahead, two open doors.

To the left, a wide pantry stretches into darkness shelves lined with jars, baskets, and sacks of grain. Silent. Still.

To the right, a bustling kitchen glows with firelight. Cooks shout orders, woks flare with blue flames, the air thick with spices and smoke.

Which path will Carlotta choose the quiet shadows of the pantry, or the chaos of the kitchen?

**Time to decide... and vote!**
