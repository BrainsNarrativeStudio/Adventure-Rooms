The group knows they have to move, fast.
They run down the stairs, hearts pounding, their steps echoing through the marble halls.

Carlotta's breath burns in her throat not from fear, but something else. The rush of it all. The performance of a lifetime.
Benicio keeps pace beside her, his mind already calculating, already searching for the angle.

One of them clutches the precious paper tight against their chest. The secret of Shangri-La.
What is this? What could it be worth?

Outside, in the courtyard, fires burn in the night.
Li-Tse steps out of the shadows, trembling.
She sees them and runs forward, eyes wet with relief.

REBEL:
"You did it. You really did it. You kept your word."

Carlotta opens her mouth, but before she can speak, a voice cuts through the night.

Brother Wilfried stands at the top of the stairs, his robe flickering in the firelight.

WILFRIED:
"Stop. Stop right there. Do you even know what you are carrying?
Tell me then. What is the great mystery of Shangri-La?"

He looks down at them, waiting for an answer.
The group hesitates.

WILFRIED:
"This is the recipe for eternal life. The true secret of this place.
Four centuries ago, a priest from Luxembourg, Father Perrault, crossed the world.
He found this valley and discovered what others only dreamed of.
He built Shangri-La as a refuge, a memory of humankind.
And he is still alive. The Grand Lama you are about to meet is that same man.
Four hundred years old, who built under our sacred Mountain this hidden city."

He turns to Li-Tse, his voice sharp.

WILFRIED:
"She wants to give this to everyone.
She would spread it across the world.
Can you imagine what that would mean?
A world where no one dies would become hell.
Do you know what kind of madness that would be?
This is too big a responsibility.
I do not enjoy it, but it is our cross to bear.

Please, strangers, the Grand Lama trusts you.
He is the one who organized for you to come here.
It was no accident. We invited you here.
Give me that paper back.
Together we can do grand things for Shangri-La and for the world."

Li-Tse's voice shakes, but her conviction doesn't.

LI-TSE:
"If you want to help the world, you could do so much.
You could do so much for your own people here.
Is this your utopia? A bunch of very old men meditating in a hidden valley?
What I imagine, you call madness. I call it hope.
You hide this secret while the world outside is dying, falling into fascism and war.
You keep it for yourselves, pretending it is mercy.
It is fear. Nothing more.

Strangers, you held your promise because you heard the truth in my words.
Give me that paper and run away with me. We can change this world."

The group freezes caught between two visions of paradise.
Carlotta feels her pulse racing. She could make history. Be remembered. Not just a singer in smoky clubs.
Benicio looks at the paper, eyes gleaming. Power. Not money, not gold something far bigger.

They stand in the middle, the page trembling between them.
Wilfried's faith against Li-Tse's fire.
Duty against rebellion.
Eternity against hope.

Do they hand the formula to Brother Wilfried to preserve the secret forever?
Or to Li-Tse to release it to the world, whatever the cost?
