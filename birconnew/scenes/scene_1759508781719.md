Carlotta successfully climbs down the window, helping Miss Takeda quietly land on a wide balcony one level below.
Arun joins them, trying to take charge, but Carlotta will not have it.

She notices the balcony runs along two adjoining rooms, each with large bay windows.

The room on the left is dark and still, probably a bedroom. Someone seems to be sleeping inside.

The room on the right has its curtains drawn. They cannot see what is there, only the faint flicker of firelight behind the fabric.

**Candidates, what do you think?**
Will Carlotta choose the known risk of the bedroom, or the total unknown behind the curtains?

**Think carefully... then it is time to vote!**
