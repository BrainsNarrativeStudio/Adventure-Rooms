You are on a plane on the way back to Europe - you escaped the chaos at the Chinese outpost.

You suddenly realize that the plane isn't going in the right direction. You try to talk to the pilot - the plane has been hijacked!!!

In the struggle, the plane goes down. Once you recover from the schock, find yourself on a snowy mountainside. A hooded figure approached you and offers you shelter. 
You can't believe your eyes when you arrive in the lush hidden valley of Shangri-La...

The offer you to share their food. What do you do?
