The Admnitrator hesitates, then, in a whisper: 

- I understand, you want to go back to your lives. You have no interest in staying here. Nothing to bring to Shangri-La. 

- I can help you. But if you get caught again by the guards, you're on your own. Our little secret, let's say.

- After escaping the palace, try to find Old Man Jenkins in the marketplace. He's been planning to climb out of the valley for years. He's the one you need if you want to one day see your families again. 

- But I didn't say anything... 

**The Administrator goes back to his work. You can now leave his room and get back to the hallway without problem**
