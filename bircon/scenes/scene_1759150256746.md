You're brought by the guards into a small office with a fireplace, where a tall man, the Administrator, is working at his desk. 

He looks at you briefly, then gestures to the guards to leave. 

- Administrator: ha, the foreigners. Barely arrived and already a problem. Weren't you told to stay in your quarters? We cannot trust you. I should get you arrested. 
 

- Tell me the truth, what were you doing? We're you trying to escape?'


**You can tell the truth about escaping, or try to lie and say you were just lost**

If they lie, the Administrator's face closes off: "Fine, we'll bring you back in the library.""
