You can now safely pass the dogs eating sausages. 

At the end pof the hallway, two guards cross from one room to the other. Sounds of laughing and drinking. Yu realise that this hallway is the guard's quarters...

But before leaving, you listen to the voice of an officer: 

- "My men are driving me crazy, don't know if we can ever find good guards in Shangri-La'. Like, the guys in the courtyard: one is always angry and won't listen; another one is weird and gullible; the third one is a great guard despite his wooden leg... But he falls asleep as soon as he hears singing! We're not made to be tough people in Shangri-La, this is a valley of peace!"

**You heard enough and go back to the hallway**
