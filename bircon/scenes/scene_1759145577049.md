This is a kid's room!

He's still sleeping.

Try to be as discreet as possible as you're crossing the room towards the main door.

But sadly, the old creaking door has an old lock that is a bit tricky. 

Will you manage to open the door without waking up the child? 

- PLay that challenge, if you make three noise, you wake up the kid...
