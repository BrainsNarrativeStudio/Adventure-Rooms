**Entering through the large wooden doors, you are ushered into the the building, and you are stunned by its calm and elegance. The sparse furniture is made of precious woods and marbles, the curtains are made of the finest silk. You step into a sort of library, filled with books, maps, objects from all the cultures on Earth.  Wilfried signals you to come sit around a large table with plates of local fruits. One of the servant gives you this box of delicacies, insisting you take it**

The narrator points to the food on the table and hands the box to one of the players.

**Please feel free to eate the food. It smells delicious. But... you do not know anything about these people... Do you eat the food?**

(In the box of lukums, if the players look into it; they can find a note saying: "This place is not what it seems, run away!")
