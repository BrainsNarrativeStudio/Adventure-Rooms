A super busy kitchen, cooks are busy in front of their fires.

Platters with sausages are ready to be served. 

A pastry chef is decorating a cake near you, but super focused. 

- No-one seems to care about you for now. It seems you can just cross the room. 

But maybe you might want to: 

 - Talk to the pastry chef?
 
 - Grab a platter of food?
 
 - Or just leave as quickly as possible
