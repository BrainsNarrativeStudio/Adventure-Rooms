title: The Crash
set:
---

Snow enters the plane from a huge crack in the fuselage. Only the wind can be heard.

You are the survivors of that rough landing.
The pilot, an old asian man, is dead. 

You look at one another, strangers now allies in adversity. 
- Introduce yourself (read the top of your character sheet)

Is any of you wounded? 
- Pick blindly a token from a box. Red: wounded. Normal token: a bonus for later. 

Someone screams outside "Anyone alive?" 
A hooded silhouette finally appears on top of the crack. In the now, a sherpa in a very warm outfit is coming to save you!

- If players ask questions, resist. The "sherpa" can only say: "no time for this, you'd froze to death. Try to get out of here!")

We could add a "freezing" timer. If they hesitate or are too slow to move, some will become "wounded". (we could easily use red bands for ""wounds"" -- this would threaten death without happening; but could create interesting conditions later: impossible to do something if too many wounded; need to choose a rest/different path or need to take the immortality potion to heal, etc.)

So it could be a kind of "escape room" puzzle to escape the crash plane.

(if "wounded" characaters, the others must decide to help them or not?)

The sherpa leads the players across wind and snow, to safety.
