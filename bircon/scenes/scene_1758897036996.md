Snow enters the plane from a huge crack in the fuselage. Only the wind can be heard.

You are the survivors of that rough landing.
The pilot, an old asian man, is dead. 

You look at one another, strangers now allies in adversity. 
- Introduce yourself (read the top of your character sheet)

Someone screams outside "Anyone alive?" 
A hooded silhouette finally appears on top of the crack. In the now, a sherpa in a very warm outfit is coming to save you!

- If players ask questions, the "sherpa" can only say: "no time for this, you'd froze to death. Try to get out of here!")

**Do you follow that Sherpa or stay in the plane?**

THis is a story you experience as a group, most decisions will have to be decided by the majority. You can debate between you, but:
- This clock is the debate time you have for the entire game. When it runs out, we will not let you debate and you will have to vote on the spot. So try to keep some time for the important decisions...

"Come, quick!"
So, do you follow the Sherpa?
