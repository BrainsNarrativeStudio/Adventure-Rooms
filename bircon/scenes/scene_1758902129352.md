You wake up in a clinic, all in the same room. The sun is rising. 

You've been saved and apparently brought to a city.

Nurses and doctors speaking a miux of languages are tending to you. They seem relieved to see you waking up. A doctor tells you it's extremely lucky you're all alive and with all your limbs intact. 

Why didn't you  follow the guide that was sent to rescue you?

Are you ready to meet with a dignitary that will explain to you where you are?
