{{#hasNot "met the rebel in the palace"}}
  REBEL LEADER:  Oh, thank the Mountain! I found you here. Did you decide to stay? Marvellous. A lot of people in our valley need you help. I don't know what you already know about Shangri-La... But it's a lie, not everything is perfect here. Of course, we respect the Grand Lama, without him the place would go up in flames. But he's being lied to, or his obessions are out of the realities of today. I fight for a valley that will be more free, where everyone can access the same chances, where we could actually help the world... And... I don't have time to explain everything, the guards are everywhere here. What I know: in a few hours, Brother Wilfried will need you to do something important. We, the people, need to know what's going on. Please, do not leave and go do whatever Wilfried wants of you. Once you're there, I'll contact you again. Please. Do not let us down. 
  
  Promise me you'll stay, follow him and try to help us!
  
  You watch her leave gracefully through the window.
