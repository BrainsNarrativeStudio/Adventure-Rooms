Turning right in the hallway, you round a corner, when, suddenly: 

- Three big black guard dogs are looking at you, growling. 

{{#has "Grabbed the platter"}}
They seem fascinated by the smell of the sausages on the platter you're carrying.
 
Quick, what do you do? 

**Back away or give them the sausages?**
{{/has}}

{{#hasNot "Grabbed the platter"}}
  Quick, what do you do? 

**Back away or pet them to try to pass behind them?**
{{/hasNot}}
