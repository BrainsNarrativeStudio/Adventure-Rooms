You walk around your quarters, see that you each have a room ready, bathrooms. It's all very luxurious, they even have modern plumbing! How? 

All the doors leading out of the aisle are closed. And the staircase is guarded by the stressed counselor lady.

You go back to the library to think. There are many interesting objects in here you could study. 

But your attention keeps being brought back to the finely wrought door with golden fittings. What could you find in Wilfried's office?
