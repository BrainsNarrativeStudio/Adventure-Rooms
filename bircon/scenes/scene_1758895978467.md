*Berlin Tempelhof, 1933*

Flight attendant: "Welcome onboard! Please pay attention to the safety instruction you can find in the enveloppe you received.

- Please open your envelope. Do not show it to other passengers. Read it carefully.

LATER, Flight attendant: "Something seems wrong. We should have landed long ago. Where is the pilot taking us?" The attendant bangs on the door of the cockpit. No answer. "It's not our pilot! I don't know what's going on, but it's safe to assume we're being hijacked".

Look at the bottom of your sheet, you see secret goals you should try to achieve to get bonuses and have the most awards at the end of the story. Maybe there is something there about being kidnapped? Grab your pencil!

- Explaination of the character sheet and bingo. This helps you figure out what your character wants. This is also how you can check how good you are at this game.

LATER: snowy mountain peaks outside. Sounds of wind. Everything shakes. The flight attendant: "Oh no, he's crazy! The pilot seems to want to land on this mountain!! BRACE!!'"

The plane crashes... Black.

**NARRATORS: Any questions about the game? Never hesitate to ask us if you have any doubts. There's no way to play badly. Are you ready? Your characters survived the crash. The cold wind wakes you up... The story starts.**
