- Berlin Tempelhof, 1933.

Flight attendant: "Welcome onboard! Please pay attention to the safety instruction you can find in the enveloppe you received.

- Please open your envelope. Do not show it to other passengers".

--> Explaination of the concept of the game, you're characters, you will have to take decisions and decide how the story goes'

LATER, Flight attendant: "Something seems wrong. We should have landed long ago. Where is the pilot taking us?" The attendant bangs on the door of the cockpit. No answer. "It's not our pilot! I don't know what's going on, but it's safe to assume we're being hijacked".

Look at the bottom of your sheet, you see secret goals you should try to achieve to get bonuses and have the most awards at the end of the story. Maybe there is something there about being kidnapped? Grab your pencil!

--> Explaination of the character sheet and bingo

LATER: snowy mountain peaks outside. Sounds of wind. Everything shakes. "Oh no, he's crazy! The pilot seems to want to land on this mountain!! BRACE!!'"

The plane crashes... Black.

**NARRATORS: Any questions about the game? Never hesitate to ask us if you have any doubts. There's no way to play badly. Are you ready? Your charcaters survived the crash. The cold wind wakes you up... The story starts.**
