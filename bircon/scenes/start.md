**The Narrators: Welcome. Thanks for joining us. We are part of a secret guild of storytellers, The Narrators, and we live to discover and tell again the best stories in the universe... We need these stories to be experienced again and again, kept alive. But some of these stories are elusive, complex. Like this one here. Full of secrets, passion, conflicting morals and visions of the world. We're still not sure how it should end... Who should win? That's why we need your help to figure out the best shape possible for this story. You seem to be a talented group of people, capable of becoming characters inside that story.**


**Let's test one of the more powerful way you can navigate through the story: making a choice. We will often ask you to decide between many possibilities. You can discuss between you if you prefer to agree; and then we'll vote. Like now: Do you agree to help us? And fight for the ending you will find the best?**
