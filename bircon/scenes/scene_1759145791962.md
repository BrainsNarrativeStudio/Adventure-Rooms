The kid wakes up, still half in his dream. 

"Oh. What? Are you... the dragon slayers??"

**You have one minute to tell him a story to make him think he's still sleeping, and you're the dragon slayers of his dream...**

If great story: the kid falls back asleep... Phew. You exit the room. 

If the story is lackluster: the kid wakes up totally "Hey, who are you??" and screams.
