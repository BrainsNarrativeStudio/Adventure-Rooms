The sherpa leads you through a perilous edge. In the snow storm, you barely see where you''re putting your feet. You have to climb icy rocks, then walk through snow up to your waist. THen, you don't realise how, but your group has passed the ridge of a narrow valley that seems like it shoulnd't be here. Snow stopped, the temperature is now pleasant. From up there you sees that the trees are green and the moutain sides are covered with cultures and flowers.

You are brought to a big building overseeing the valley below, something like a palace or an imposing monastery, with golden domes on top of towers and an architecture you cannot place; mixing oriental, arabic and art-deco europen influences.
