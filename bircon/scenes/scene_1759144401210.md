- You sucessfully climb down the window, helping one another, and land on a spacious balcony one level down. 

- The balcony runs along three different rooms: 

- DARK ROOM: It's dark and quiet in there, you can make out this is a bedroom. Is someone sleeping? 

- FIREPLACE ROOM: The curtains are drawn, you cannot see anything inside but you can see the dancing light of a fireplace. 

- KITCHEN: The window shows you part of a busy kitchen, several cooks are shaking woks. 

**Which room do you try to enter?**
