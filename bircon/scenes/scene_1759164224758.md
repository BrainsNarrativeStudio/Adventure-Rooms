You keep on advancing into the courtyard. There are three exits, each guarded by one guard: 

- EXIT LEFT: A small round guard is pacing nervously around the West entry. He puffes and groans, then, out of nowhere punches the wall! 

- EXIT STRAIGHT: A guard is very focused on the North entry, standing still despite his wooden leg.

- EXIT RIGHT: A lanky guard is seating on a stool in front of the East entry. He's talking to himself and seems a bit strange...

**You can still give up and go back to the library. Or you have to choose one of the exit to try and escape. What do youdo?**
