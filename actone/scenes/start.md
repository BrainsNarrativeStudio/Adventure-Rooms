Berlin Tempelhof, 1933. 

Flight attendant: "Welcome onboard! Please pay attention to the safety instruction you can find in the enveloppe you received. Please open your envelope. Do not show it to other passengers".

--> Explaination of the concept of the game, you're characters, you will have to take decisions and decide how the story goes'

LATER: "Something seems wrong. We should have landed long ago. Where is the pilot taking us?" The attendant bangs on the door of the cockpit. No answer. "It's not our pilot! I don't know what's going on, but it's safe to assume we're being hijacked".

Look at the bottom of your sheet, you see secret goals you should try to achieve to get bonuses and have the most awards at the end of the story. Maybe there is something there about being kidnapped? Grab your pencil!

--> Video Explaination of the character sheet and bingo

LATER: projection of mouttain peaks outside. Sounds of wind. Everything shakes. "Oh no, he's crazy! The pilot seems to want to land on this mountain!! BRACE!!'" 

The plane crashes... Black.

(idea for later: some would be wounded by a random or voluntary system - and we could track wounds??)
