The sherpa takes you in a dark room. 

There, in a ray of light, the sherpa loses their hood and you meet... The NARRATOR!

The *Narrator*: I am part of a secret guild of storytellers, The Narrators, and we live to discover and tell again the best stories in the universe... We need these stories to be experienced again and again, kept alive. But some of these stories are elusive, complex. Like this one here. We're still not sure how it should end... That's why we need your help to figure out the best shape possible for this story. Do you agree to help us? And live through this story as charcaters? Fight for the best ending for you?

First ""vote"" tutorial.
