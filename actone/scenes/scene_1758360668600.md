Snow enters the plane from a huge crack in the fuselage. 
Only the wind can be heard. 

A hooded silhouette finally enters. A sherpa coming to save you! 

(question: how do we prevent -- or allow -- players to roleplay here? They could ask questions, resist. I say we let them and the "sherpa" can only say: "no time for this, you'd froze to death. Follow me!'")

We could add a "freezing" timer. If they hesitate or are too slow to move, some will become "wounded". (we could easily use red bands for ""wounds"" -- this would threaten death without happening; but could create interesting conditions later: impossible to do something if too many wounded; need to choose a rest/different path or need to take the immortality potion to heal, etc.)

So it could be a kind of "escape room" puzzle to escape the crash plane.

(if several groups playing in parralel, several "sherpas" divide the players into groups of 6)

(if "wounded" characaters, the others must decide to help them or not?)

The sherpa leads the players across wind and snow, to safety.
