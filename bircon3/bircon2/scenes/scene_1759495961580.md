The sherpa leads the group through a perilous edge. In the snow storm, they barely see where they're putting their feet. They have to climb icy rocks, then walk through snow up to the waist. Then, withiut realising how, the group has passed the ridge of a narrow valley that seems like it shoulnd't be here. Snow stopped, the temperature is now pleasant. From up there one can see that the trees are green and the moutain sides are covered with cultures and flowers.

How is this possible in the middle of the Himalayas highest peaks? Are they dreaming?

The group is brought to a big building overseeing the valley below, something like a palace or an imposing monastery, with golden domes on top of towers and an architecture they cannot place; mixing oriental, arabic and art-deco europen influences.
