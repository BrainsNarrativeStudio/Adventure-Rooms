As soon as the group mentions this sentence, the woman inside falls silent, and the characters hear the different locks of the door being opened one by one.

The woman looks at the group with reverence. "I did not know Wilfried had already trusted you with that knowledge. Heavy is the crown. We believe in you. Praise the Mountain."

She lifts an old WW1 rifle, then lowers it, ashamed. "This is one of the only firearms in Shangri-La. We are not used to violence here. But I do not have to tell you how important what is in this room is. You know better than anyone."

With that, she leaves the group alone in the tiny room.
