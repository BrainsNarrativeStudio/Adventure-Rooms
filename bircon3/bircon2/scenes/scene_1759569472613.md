  The silent monks stop in an hallway and one of them opens a door. They usher the group into a small spartiate office with a fireplace, where a tall man, the Administrator, is working at a small tidy desk.

He looks at the group briefly, then gestures to the monks to leave.

  The curtains open and the characters face whoever is there. A slander man in a strict coat is sizing them up. He gestures for them to enter his office : small, with a fireplace, where he, the Administrator, was working at a small tidy desk.

Administrator: ""ha, the foreigners. Barely arrived and already a problem. Weren't you told to stay in your quarters? Of course, we cannot trust you. Our peaceful society is not ready to face outside elements or criminals...

Tell me the truth, what were you doing roaming the palace? Were you trying to escape?"

What do you think your characters whould do? Tell the truth about escaping, or try to lie and say they were just lost...
