The group does not have the time to show their decision. Suddenly, the door opens and reveals...

ADMINISTRATOR: Stop.
The Grand Lama has been found dead in his chambers. Murdered.
And these outsiders were seen near the restricted wings.
It has to be them.

WILFRIED: What are you saying? The Grand Lama? Dead? That is impossible.

The Administrator has monks push the rebel prisoner in front of him.

LI-TSE: I did not kill him. None of us did.
But this is what happens when you hide from the world.
You keep your secret, and the world breaks in anyway.
Wilfred, listen to me.
Do not let Kim twist this for power.
This is the moment to open Shangri-La.
To let light in.

ADMINISTRATOR: Take them. All of them.

Monks run to circle the courtyard.
Nowhere to go.

Will the group manage to prove their innocence by finding the killer? Will they help fulfill the plans of the Lama?

You will be able to do it yourself next year in the full BRAINSCAPE!
