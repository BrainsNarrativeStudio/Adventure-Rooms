This is now a story of betrayal and double agents. The group has decided to lie to Wilfried to better go being his back and steal his secret for the Administrator. 

They tell him that they got nothing conclusive out of Administrator Kim. Wilfried is visibly disappointed, and lets go a long sigh. 

"It's okay, I'm sure you did your best. For reasons that will become clear later, I believe in you, people. The best thing you can do now, is rest a few hours. I'll come get you."

Coast is clear. The group looks around in the library, they learned from the rebel that this is where the clues are hidden to get through the secret door!
