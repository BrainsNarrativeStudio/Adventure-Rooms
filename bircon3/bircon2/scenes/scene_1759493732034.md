Snow enters the plane from a huge crack in the fuselage. Only the wind can be heard.

Your six characters are the only survivors of that rough landing. The pilot, an old asian man, is dead.

The chacracters look at one another, strangers now allies in adversity.

Introduce briefly your character to the group, tell only what you want to share (read the top of your character sheet - I think they should ALL have secrets!)

- "Hello?" 

Someone screams outside "Anyone alive?" A hooded silhouette finally appears on top of the crack. In the now, a sherpa in a very warm outfit is coming to save the group!

If players ask questions, the "sherpa" can only say: "no time for this, you'd froze to death. Try to get out of here!")

Do you follow that Sherpa or stay in the plane?

Let's test one of the more powerful way you can navigate through this story: making a choice, as a group. Most decisions will be decided by the majority. You can debate between yourselves then you'll vote by putting one or maybe several tokens in the corresponding numbered platter of the story balance.


"So, quick! Does the group follow the Sherpa out of the crashed plane?
