The strange guard talks to himself as you're approaching:

A group of epople in the middle of the night?
It's in your head, silly.
Don't call me silly. What if they're enemies?
Then you'd have to stop them.
How can I tell if they"re enemies?
We should ask them questions...
Great idea! Hey, strangers, answer my questions by YES or NO.
Here we go:
(if one wrong: - Ha! They answered wrong!! - We shall stop them if they make one more mistake!)

(if two wrong : the game stop and he arrests the players!)

- Are you allowed to be here? (NO)
- Do you think I should let you go? (YES)
- Am I the best guard? 	(NO)
- Would arresting you be good for my carreer (YES)
- Was there chicken for lunch? (NO)

(if only one wrong at the end: oh, you really care for me, I should let you go.)
