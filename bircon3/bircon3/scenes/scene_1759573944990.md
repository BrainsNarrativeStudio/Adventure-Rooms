The characters quickly, by pure instinct of fear, line up against the wall as the curtains of that room open brutaly. The closest charcaters can guess the silhouette of a tall, thin man, observing outside. He doesn't see them and closes the curtains again. Phew. 

Now they know who is in that room. 

They could decide to meet that man face on, or go though the dark bedroom.
