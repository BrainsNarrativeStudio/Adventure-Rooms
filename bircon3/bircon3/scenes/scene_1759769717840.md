The Administrator got tired and suspiscious of the group and sends the characters away. 

The group is silent and unsure of the next steps. What weird joke did fate play on them? From crashing here, to being prisoners, to causing the arrest of a woman and now failing at their one chance to prove their worth. They feel like losers. 

That's in this mindset that they find Wilfried to tell him that they got nothing conclusive out of Administrator Kim. Wilfried is visibly disappointed, and lets go a long sigh. 

"It's okay, I'm sure you did your best. For reasons that will become clear later, I believe in you, people. The best thing you can do now, is rest a few hours. I'll come get you."

The group feels uplifted by this comment. They needed to feel special. They are suddenly inspired to do something, anything. But what? It seems that every door have closed. Will they stay there doing nothing, waiting to know whatever that ceremony is supposed to be? 

No. They know something is to be done. As they look around them, they notice many elements in this library that seem useful. Maybe they can figure out something themselves!
