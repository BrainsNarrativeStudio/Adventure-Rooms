The door opens and Wilfried enters, puzzled to realise he's stopping the group in a passionated debate. The group points to the window and explains briefly what happens with that strange woman.

Wilfried screams some orders and soon dozens of monks are running across the courtyard down there, trying to find that woman. Finally they catch her as she was about to leave the premisses. 

From up here, the group can guess Li-Tsen's jaw locking, and she looks up toward the window with pure hate in her eyes. She screams: "How could you do this? I don't know what the Lama sees in you." Two Monks grab her and drag her away. 

The group feels bad, and can only hope this move will put them in better graces with the authority here.
