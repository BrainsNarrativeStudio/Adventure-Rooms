- Tempelhof, Berlin, 1933.

Six strangers in biog winter coats, the men smoking, board a small plane, less than 20 passengers. THey seat in the wicker chair, and look at one another. They all have reasons of flying out of a troubled Germany, with talks of war and speeches of strong men resonating in their minds.

A flight attendant smiles at them: "Welcome onboard! Please pay attention to the safety instruction you can find in the enveloppe you received.

Please open your envelope. Read it carefully. This is the character you will be guiding today. You can decide on their first name yourself? And you can read more about their story and motivation. 

But if fighting for your character is one thing, Brainscapes are interactive stories you play as a group, debating and deciding together what these charcaters should do and how the story should progress.

You can see a "Checklist" on the second part of your character sheet. They're all different for all of you, except the first line that say "LEaving Berlin". 

**The passengers can feel the plane shake and the engine noise fills in the cabin. Altitude's cold surprises the travellers. It's done, they're leaving Germany**

So, you all did it, you can check that box. And because you completed that line, you earn a token.

Pay attention to this checklist, the more you create or inherit situations when you can check these boxes, the more tokens you will earn. Tokens are necessary to vote and influence the group's deicsions. Use them wisely.

LATER, Flight attendant: "Something seems wrong. We should have landed long ago. Where is the pilot taking us?" The attendant bangs on the door of the cockpit. No answer. "It's not our pilot! I don't know what's going on, but it's safe to assume we're being hijacked".

**The group of strangers look at one another, fear seizes them, unless that feeling is also the delicious spark of adventure and excitmeent that an unkown situation can create...**

-

LATER: snowy mountain peaks outside. Sounds of wind. Everything shakes. The flight attendant: "Oh no, he's crazy! The pilot seems to want to land on this mountain!! BRACE!!'"

The plane crashes... Black.
