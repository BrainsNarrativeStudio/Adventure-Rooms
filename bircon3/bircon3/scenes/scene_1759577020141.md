The group reaches the end of the straircase and exits in a large stone courtyard. The moon shines brightly in the sky and is reflected by the snow on all the moutains surrounded ther Valley. 

The group keeps on advancing into the courtyard. There are three exits, each guarded by one monk:

EXIT LEFT: A small round monk is pacing nervously around the West entry. He puffes and groans, then, out of nowhere punches the wall! Intinctively, the characters know it would be pointless to even try exiting this way.

The two other exits are more promising:

EXIT STRAIGHT: A monk is very focused on the North entry, standing still despite his wooden leg.

EXIT RIGHT: A lanky monk is seating on a stool in front of the East entry. He's talking to himself and seems quite strange and agitated...

What will the group do? 

Face the good monk or risk it with the strange one?
